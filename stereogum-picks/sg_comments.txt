The year that could have been…

After spending 2019 reflecting on an entire decade of music, I was more than happy to switch gears in 2020 and digest as much new music as possible. I stopped that pretty hard in March and simply reached for comfort music the rest of the year. As much as I’d like to have included newer artists and highlight newer albums here at the end of 2020, my list is fairly thick with new music from old favorites.

raptor jesus’ top 20 albums of 2020:

01. Yves Tumor — Heaven to a Tortured Mind
02. Pure X — Pure X
03. SALEM — Fires in Heaven
04. Dua Lipa — Future Nostalgia
05. Tame Impala — The Slow Rush
06. Cut Copy — Freeze, Melt
07. Run The Jewels — RTJ4
08. 070 Shake — Modus Vivendi
09. Yung Lean — Starz
10. A.A.L. — 2017 - 2019

11. The Avalanches — We Will Always Love You
12. Dogleg — Melee
13. Fiona Apple — Fetch The Bolt Cutters
14. Jay Electronica — A Written Testimony
15. Sufjan Stevens — The Ascension
16. Caribou — Suddenly
17. Destroyer — Have We Met
18. Four Tet — Sixteen Oceans
19. Grimes — Miss Anthropocene
20. Various Artists — After Dark 3

My favorite 2020 memory was driving on a farm road in Texas listening to Pure X this summer. Perfect blue skies. Vivid green grass from all the rain that preceded July. Driving on a recently paved black road so fresh it didn’t even have yellow lines. I passed more cows than cars on my way to visit an old friend. All the while, the Texas natives Pure X soundtracked a scenery that was likely similar to what inspired the music (just look at that blue album cover). I had already listened to the new Pure X dozens of times, so the marriage of the visuals and audio really helped pull me out of the reality that I had previously been stuck in my home for months. It felt like freedom that afternoon.

But Yves Tumor is an ascendent rockstar that made a perfect album and we need to herald them as such.

It kills me that Yves Tumor has yet to tour this album because I'm sure it will be a bananas live show.

Yves is holding strong as my AOTY.

For a year with so much good music, SG managed to pick a lot of the most forgettable albums. To each their own.

12/1/20 12:47 PM+3REPLY

Ugh, you're a villain for hearing the new Avalanches before the rest of us.

Love your list! I thought the new Tame Impala was super slept-on, it did such a good job of navigating more emotionally complex situations than the heartbreak of Currents, while also sounding like several different eras of pop music blended together on like every song. And the Against All Logic album was a fittingly jagged soundtrack for this roughshod year, "If You Can't Do It Good Do It Hard" is SOTY IMO.

12/1/20 10:34 AM+8REPLY

raptor jesus
Actually I'm a villain for putting it on my list WITHOUT having heard it. I figured I've heard enough pre-singles and have enough faith in the Avalanches that it was deserving of a spot regardless. Especially if it HAD actually just been released, I would gladly let the recency bias shoot it up super high on the list without thinking much about it.

Now THAT'S a premature evaluation.

I'm sure everyone has a joke of WHY Tame Impala was "slept-on," but all my friends love Tame Impala so it was the natural go to pick for summer 2020. I think it's a much tighter release than Currents and still has a wealth of great songs.

I was playing "If You Can't Do It Good Do It Hard" and during the first half, my friend asked what the fuck I was playing. When Lydia started yelling, he shut the fuck up so fast. Such a powerful track.

TONS I haven't heard yet, but here's my top, let's say 25, as of Dec. 1.

1. Waxahatchee - Saint Cloud
2. Jessie Ware - What's Your Pleasure?
3. Oranssi Pazuzu - Mestarin Kynsi

That's three 10s off the top. Those things are hard to call the year of, but I couldn't deny them. What's most astonishing is that with two of the artists, I never really cared for their work previous, and with the third - Waxahatchee - I enjoyed, but assumed had a lower ceiling. She shattered it with this one.

4. RTJ - RTJ4
5. Pinegrove - Marigold (sorry, I still roll with Pinegrove)
6. Jeff Rosenstock - No Dream
7. Gulch - Impenetrable Cerebral Fortress
8. Westside Gunn - WHO MADE THE SUNSHINE (West's best)
9. Jeff Parker - Suite For Max Brown
10. Ben Seretan - Youth Pastoral
11. Daniel Romano - "How Ill Thy World Is Formed"
12. Potion - Cemetary EP (just heard it yesterday, but what the hell, I'm putting it here)
13. Lydia Loveless - Daughter (the best Neko Case album not made by Neko Case)
14. 2nd Grade - Hit To Hit
15. Jay Electronica - A Written Testimony
16. Code Orange - Underneath (so wonderfully dumb)
17. CHIKA - INDUSTRY GAMES
18. Adrianne Lenker - songs/instrumentals
19. Coriky - Coriky
20. DRAIN - California Cursed
21. Those Dirty Projectors EPs
22. Elder - Omens (the vocals are meh, but man the band do some incredible things here)
23. Mil-Spec - World House (a nice space filler when waiting for a new Propagandhi)
24. Sam Hunt - SOUTHSIDE (sometimes I love it)
25. Fiona Apple - Fetch The Bolt Cutters (Fiona never came naturally to me...I'm still working on it).

I appreciate the Pinegrove love! Marigold is easily their most cohesive batch of new songs yet, not simply re-works of their pre-Cardinal catalog. I'm looking forward to what Evan, Zac and crew have in store for the future. If you haven't checked it out, Megan's new album 'Tender Kid' as Chuck Is A Band is a good quick indie rock ripper. Sam Skinner also has a new album coming out in the new year to look forward to. Quite the creative bunch!

'Welcome to Conceptual Beach' is a solid reinterpretation of Young Jesus's sound. While I liked the classic mid-aughts emo of their earlier albums, the almost-jams and complex arrangements are so good, every time it's popped into my head I have to listen to the album front to back.

12/1/20 10:10 AM+11REPLY

mr. gruff the atheist goat
Like our raptor friend, most of the new music I listened to were the hotly anticipated new albums from old favorites. But there were some surprises!
Fiona Apple and Caribou somehow made the best music of their careers, late into their careers, topping even the astonishing high points of The Idler Wheel... and Our Love (or Up In Flames, take your pick). Same with Yves Tumor and Fontaines D.C., who have now entered the ranks of essential artists.
I've casually enjoyed Paramore in the past, but I had no idea Hayley Williams could make something as weird and rewarding as Petals for Armor.
Nap Eyes were the one previously unheard by me artist that caught my attention this year, when the impossible to ignore "Mark Zuckerberg" came up on some shuffled playlist. This band is totally in my sweet spot of catchy tunes paired with clever lyrics that exist somewhere along the spectrum of They Might Be Giants to Courtney Barnett.
Meanwhile, RTJ delivered exactly what we rely on them for which felt especially vital this year. Haim released their Modern Vampires of the City. Grimes made her most Grimes album ever.

"The Valley" is a perfect closing song for sure, and I feel like "Killing Floor" is the perfect opener, and I feel like "Ancestral Recall" is the perfect mid-album song to keep the train rolling.

I see Making The Door Less Open as more of a transitional work from his material till now, which helped me process my feelings towards it. Its not a bad album in any way, its just very all over the place. So this album's legacy in my head is very much dependent on what they release next.

I'm pumped for you on the Pink Floyd front. They get lumped into the "cheesy stoner bands you can only like in High School" category, but Dark Side of the Moon, Animals, Wish You Were Here, and Meddle are 4 of the best front-to-back Albums of all time. FWIW I think Dark Side is the greatest album ever made, and not in a "that's just my opinion, man," way - the combination of avant-garde noise with rock with melody with production is still mind-blowing decades later. Beyond the technical stuff, "Us vs. Them," "Money," "Time," Great Gig in the Sky," etc. are truly gorgeous, transcendent songs.

Probably their most underrated but I think if most people heard DSOTM without the cultural baggage it would still be their consensus #1. On the other hand, I'm glad the culture caught up with The Wall being mostly garbage, because when I was in HS that was the most popular choice.

12/1/20 12:40 PM+2REPLY

I agree with you on the objective best album ever for DSOTM (though I am still 100% in the Meddle is my favorite fandom). Combined with the fact that despite its strangeness, it's one of the best selling records of all time. Then as far as iconic album covers go... a truly incredible album. It's also why I love Meddle so much. The band that made DSOTM didn't do it out of nowhere. They were already churning at full speed. It's why the following run of albums are also great. Gotta love an album so great that all the band's albums released around it are all considered classics as well.

I like Ascension more than The Age of Adz, and honestly, i expected better from the TAoA fandom. The folkjan fandom wants us to not like Ascension, and that is all the more reason to stan this magnificent bop for the ages.

Hot take- in an alternate reality where fetch the bolt cutters was released in a pandemic-free environment.. would people be as hot for it as critics seem to be for it this year? I love fiona and I definitely tried to get into it but it never really landed the way her other albums did.

I appreciate it, maybe I'll come back and love it with time but it's not in my top 20 of 2020.

I like your “finally clicked” as i had the same experience, put st cloud on a lark after years of not caring about-to-actively disliking waxahatchee and was just absolutely floored, havent had that kind of interaction with a record in how many years

Agree with biggest disappointment sufjan for music at least but i think my actual biggest media disappointment of 2020 was doom eternal. How do you make a perfect game and then fuck up every single good thing about it in the sequel!? Still mad about that

My local alt-rock station, which plays mostly Imagine Dragons and bands that sound just like Imagine Dragons, started playing Car Seat Headrest this year. That's how I knew Will fucked up.

12/1/20 2:55 PM0REPLY

thiscity
the way i have consumed music in 2020 has been weird and fitful and my lack of a commute has left me less time to like, sit and listen to an album from front to back, even though i have more free time than ever. i spend a lot of time putting music on repeat in the background and letting it seep into me slowly while i sleep or play final fantasy or do other things, and so i don’t really have a “top ten” (i’ve never really been a “top ten” person) and there are lots of things i still want to get around to but haven’t or need to explore more because i spend a week listening to nothing but that snail mail record on repeat for 16 hours a day or whatever. so instead here are some brief thoughts on some records from this year.

Jeff Rosenstock - No Dream
i guess this is probably what i would call my AOTY, though i think it’s still my third favorite Jeff record behind Worry. and POST-. we all know what Jeff does and what Jeff does makes him a singular songwriter and we’re all better off having him in our lives. no one else quite captures our current world in all it’s shitty ragged glory, and this is more of that, and that’s awesome. feel like one of these days he’s gonna really go wild on some synths for a whole record and that’s gonna be a glorious day.

Knot - Knot
of course. knot is a different band than krill and krill wrote songs about being a fucked up and miserable twenty-something and that’s still where i am in my life so this record didn’t quite ascend to the level of earth shattering importance that their older material did - which is fine. this is still a fantastic and under appreciated record about how to be a happy, responsible, and ethical person under late capitalism and also it has insane riffs. i think in a lot of ways this is the smartest and most empathetic record i listened to this year and this is a record i will return to and find new meaning in for years to come.

Nicolas Jaar - 2020
nico didn’t put out a single record i liked as much as Sirens this year, but the cumulative effect of the avalanche of new music he unleashed made something exceptionally clear to me: nicolas jaar is in my estimation the most vital artist we have (except for maybe Frank Ocean) and i will follow him anywhere he wants to go. industrial house, experimental psychedelic pop, 15 minute tone poems, live tracks from 6 years ago, whatever it is, man, i’m in.

Western State Hurricanes - Through With Love
this got absolutely no attention anywhere. as a big fan of the seemingly forgotten but fiercely beloved (by me at least) 2000s indie project The Long Winters, it’s a miracle that this album of what were thought to be unsalvageable recordings from john roderick’s pre-TLW band exists at all. i’m not sure if this is a “for fans only” release or not: if you’re familiar with the Long Winters catalogue, it’s fascinating to hear those songs with completely different arrangements. if you’re unfamiliar, it might be interesting as an artifact of the late 90’s seattle indie scene right before it blew up; these guys were playing these songs when co-headlining with pre-fame Death Cab. if there is an alternate universe where the Western State Hurricanes were the next big buzz band, this is a peak into it.

okay i don’t want to take up too much more space so here are 5 more under-discussed albums (plus one EP) from this year that are worth your time:

Owen Pallett - Island
Father John Misty - Off Key In Hamburg
Ty Dolla $ign - Featuring Ty Dolla $ign
Kali Uchis - To Feel Alive / Sin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios) ∞
070 Shake - Modus Vivendi

and here are 5 albums that everybody else liked that i ALSO liked and listened to a lot

Sufjan Stevens - The Ascension
Fleet Foxes - Shore
Gorillaz - Song Machine Volume 1
Grimes - Miss Anthropocene
The Weeknd - After Hours

I loved the bookended opening/closing with the mid album interlude. Definitely gets a little shaky (boooo!) in the back half but album closer "Flight319" is a head turner of a closing verse.

A lot of the albums higher upon this list are heavily weighted towards the latter half of the year. It kinda feels like 'Have We Met''s January release was forgotten about with so much chaos and so much music since. It's easily one of the best albums of the year, if not Dan's whole career.

Stray thoughts:

Trace Mountains was the runaway winner of the "Record I throw on when I just can't choose what to listen to" award.

I had the strongest *emotional* response to I'm Glad It's You, The Ascension (title track), and SAULT. As far as I'm Glad It's You, I mean, straight up blubbering at the pain and release of these songs. I'll leave that at that.

(I also got emotional at multiple points during LIVE DRUGS lmao)

NOACF isn't perfect but the middle third on its own is basically a full album in itself and is so fucking awesome, to say nothing of the great tracks outside that run.

Artists I had been previously pretty agnostic on that I loved this year: Waxahatchee, Fleet Foxes, Young Jesus

HAIM is comeback artist of the year. They killed it.

12/1/20 11:32 AM+7REPLY

Women in Music Part III is really stellar. The more I listen to it the more it creeps up my rankings.

Strangest Thing is prob my favorite Drugs song...and I do like the cut on this live album.

BUT

It drives me nuts after the first solo when they mellow back out for the "Be the writer of your own story" section before blasting back off for the second guitar solo. IDK, it just bums me out.

With that said, I'm being pedantic. LIVE DRUGS rules and I'm going to be listening to it forever.

Trace Mountains is one that I put on once and forgot about, but then it would keep coming up on shuffle when I would go on my daily walks with my 1 year old daughter and it just slowly wriggled its way into my brain.

Mostly talking about the big names. Nothing was aggressively bad (except Bieber maybe) but it was just all so bland to me.

If listmas 2020 has taught me one thing this year is that I am not as *here* for the disco revival as I thought I would be. Jessie Ware made my favorite disco/pop album of this year, though and it’s not even close.

I guess I’m lying because Charli is in my top 20. But I don’t put her in with the Dua Lipa/Lady Gaga/Ariana crowd in my head, cause if she were than “Gone” would have charted wayyy higher.

I wouldn't put her in that group either, i've always seen Charli as more of an indie pop artist even if she is signed to a major label mostly bc her label doesnt know what in the fuck to do with her

Other REALLY good albums that I liked this year but either forgot when rushing to submit my official #list or didn't quite make the cut but are still worthy:

Yves Tumor
The Strokes
Gillian Welch's massive output
Charley Crockett
Shamir
Andy Shauf
The Killers
The Beths
Christian Lee Hutson

Albums I didn't like as much as everyone else apparently:

Haim (not bad...merely pleasant to my ears)
Jason Isbell (one of my favorite musicians, but this album felt like a retread/step back)
Soccer Mommy (Circle the Drain is one of my favorite songs of the year, but the rest of the album didn't love up to that song's promise IMO).

Totally agree re: Circle the Drain

I was leading this charge at 1/2 year time but I will say that Color Theory grew on me more than I expected.

12/1/20 11:44 AM+4REPLY

Same, I think there's a lot of good stuff happening there even if the songwriting isn't consistently aces. Still "Circle the Drain" - legendary song.

12/1/20 11:47 AM+2REPLY

padfoot24 (in reply to dansolo)
I think the songwriting IS consistently aces, but it’s not as punchy as what we’re used to. More languid, spindly, but tight band grooves, fewer bedroom pop bangers, and the lyrics follow suit. Typical grower kind of stuff, and it’s been a godsend during early onset SAD season.

12/1/20 1:26 PM0REPLY

Xander Alex H (in reply to dansolo)
'Circle the Drain' would've topped the Billboard 100 chart if it came out between 1998-2001. Amazing distillation of the 90's indie rock vibe.

12/1/20 1:12 PM+3REPLY

bakedbeans (in reply to dansolo)
when "Circle the Drain" and "Me & You Together Song" came out the same week, yeah, you could say i felt that.

And just to pile on, my 2020 musically is probably actually defined by my deep dive into Talking Heads' full discography, and a couple of playlists I made (one focusing on Power Pop from the early 70's on, one on 90's and early 00's mainstream country, and one called Stay at Home that was just a smorgasbord with a ton of 80's British music on it, particularly XTC).

Also a lot of comfort food type stuff like Ben Folds Five, The New Pornographers, REM and The Shins.

01. Mare Cognitum & Spectral Lore - Wanderers: Astrology of the Nine

Exactly what I want from black metal. Massive, beautiful, intense, and reaching for something higher. It's black metal as ritual. As it should. There's something comforting about two musicians on opposite ends of the world coming out with something so perfect in 2020.

02. Oranssi Pazuzu – Mestarin Kynsi
03. Fiona Apple – Fetch The Bolt Cutters
04. Emma Ruth Rundle & Thou – May Our Chambers Be Full

06. Gulch – Impenetrable Cerebral Fortress
07. Pallbearer – Forgotten Days
08. Couch Slut – Take a Chance On Rock n Roll
09. Boldy James & Sterling Toles – Manger On McNichols

12. Svalbard – When I Die, Will I Get Better?

Black metal albums are always good running albums (it's the blast beats) especially this one. The build up on "Earth (The Mother)" alone...

12/1/20 11:09 AM+2REPLY

Yessss and then the riff on Venus is just pure self-immolation fuel. Sometimes I’ll start my run on Earth so that I can make sure that I finish with Neptune or Uranus, too.

Other albums I enjoyed running to this year:
Svalbard (duh)
Aara
Spiritworld (short run MVP)
Kvelertak
Serpent Column
Obsequiae

12/1/20 11:48 AM+3REPLY

lobster man
Oh yeah. The layered piano bit on "Uranus" leading back into that gallop at the end is huge. People! Ya gotta listen to this album. I'm convinced it's the best metal album to come out in forever.

Anyway, Svalbad and Spiritworld were running albums for me too. The big non metal running album for me was Yves'.

Esoctrilihum *cough cough*. I forgot all about Huntsmen, as well.

But yeah, I'm not the biggest fan of modern heavy metal (I prefer my metal dripping with razor blades and kerosene) but the fact that there are two on my list is yet another indicator of how strong this year is all around.

"Stare Spells" is the Infant Island track for me. We needs live shows for a multitude of reasons, but #1 is so we can mosh to that.

There are also minimum 20 other records that could have climbed into this list had I had the time. I’ll save all my fawning for the Metal list since this is just 20 metal records but my non-Metal albums of the year are Phoebe and Soft Kill.

All three of those records could be #1's in any other year. MSW is the record I've most fervently looking forward to finding a distro in the UK, I should have a copy by 2021! Atramentus provided the best "full package" of the year, the map and short story the accompany the album flesh the experience out into something worth fully investing your time into. I'm usually always working or playing videogames or idly scrolling the 'Gum whilst I'm listening to music but Atramentus had me set aside everything to immerse myself in what really boils down to an especially Lovecraftian DND campaign. Meanwhile, Eternal Champ proved they are the Eternal Champs by outriffing EVERYONE, including themselves.

Don't think its gotten a love of PR (no p4k review for example), so probably just not on people's radars. I wouldn't have heard it at all probably if I hadn't randomly heard If I Told on Hype Machine, which just blew me away.

Now that it got a Grammy nom maybe hopefully it'll get a little more love.

Yesterday I was sort of reviewing my own 2020 playlist, thinking about my annual top 25 list, and I couldn't believe how much music from the beginning of the year seemed to be from a lifetime ago. That U.S. Girls album? Francis Quinlan? Grimes finally putting out a new one, and it was a dud? Did these things really happen?

12/1/20 10:27 AM+4REPLY

Spudlord
I saw two shows in 2020 and I feel fortunate in that regard, sadly. If my last memory of live music is Torche dropping hammers on my skull with meat then I suppose I can't complain. The hammers were not meat-laden, for clarity's sake. The other was Blood Invantation which involved dropping acid filled weather balloons on my brain.

Here are some tasty spuds:
1. Mare Cognitun & Spectral Lore - Wanderers: Astrology Of the Nine
2. Thou & Emma Ruth Rundle - May Our Chambers Be Full
3. Black Curse - Endless Wound
4. Nap Eyes - Snapshot Of a Beginner
5. Porridge Radio - Every Bad
6. Pantha du Prince - Conference Of Trees
7. Fluisteraars - Bloem
8. Eternal Champion - Ravening Iron
9. Couch Slut - Take A Chance On Rock N' Roll
10. Woods - Strange To Explain
11. Moodyman - Taken Away
12. Sweven - The Eternal Resonance
13. Wake - Devouring Ruin
14. REZN - Chaotic Divine
15. Spirit Adrift - Enlightened In Eternity
16. My Morning Jacket - The Waterfall II
17. Jason Isbell & The 400 Unit - Reunions
18. Midwife - Forever
19. Bedsore - Hypnagogic Hallucinations
20. Hum - Inlet

SOTY: "Rune's Heart" - Panopticon. One of the most heart-wrenching, touching black metal songs you'll ever hear.

Hell yeah, I saw the Forest Hills summer show and am glad I got that in, as badly as I wanted to go to one of the Red Rocks ones.

Like so many others, new music wasn't really something I had much head space for this year. I don't think I can really put together an ordered list, but I think Dua Lipa put out my AotY. Jessie Ware and Woods would also be very high on the list. Yumi Zouma, Cable Ties, Sault (x2), Nada Surf, Perfume Genius, The Heliocentrics, Pantha du Prince, Yves Tumor, and Frances Quinlan might round out some of an unordered list...

12/1/20 10:32 AM+2REPLY

Looking at these lists and I realized I probably listened to jazz at a 70% clip compared to other genres this year. Working on a top 20 jazz alhums and top 20 jazz songs of 2020, but I'll probably post that on the December jazz column.

I don't have anything like the patience required to craft and fine tune a list, so instead I'd like to chuck some stuff out there that doesn't appear here that I really enjoyed. In general the 'Gum is pretty good at keeping up with the music scene here across the point - UK jazz, grime, metal and hardcore all get excellent coverage - but you have an odd blind spot, shared by the other site, for UK psych/noise madness, a scene flourishing as surely as any other. Many of my favourite records of the year sprouted out of this fetid swamp of gnarly riffs; Luminous Bodies' Nah Nah Nah Yeah Yeah, Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs' Viscerals, We Wild Blood's Vicious Virtues (probably my overall favourite of the year, if you forced me to make a decision) and the mighty Hey Colossus' Dances/Curses are all wonderful albums, and I thoroughly recommend them to anyone who wants to headbang this shithole of a year out of sight and out of mind.

And now a big ol' list of some other stuff I really liked, for the sake of it; Pa Salieu (been on repeat since it dropped last week), Uada, Chubby & The Gang, Irreversible Entanglements, Ulcerate, Shirley Collins, Incantation, Wake, Inexorum, Nubya Garcia, Sault, Villaelvin, Esoctrilihum, Nazar, Westerman, Bambara, Henn Ogled, Raul Monsalve, Pyrrhon, R.A.P. Ferreira, Nap Eyes, Dogleg, Nate Wooley, Motorpsycho, The Koreatown Oddity, Destroyer, Elvis Costello. There'll be loads more, obviously - I think I actively sought out more music than ever, thanks to the state we all currently find ourselves in, and I'll never get round the giving everything that deserves it the love I want to.

I always make sure to at least check out every top 5 album that I haven't heard yet, so HAIM and Waxahatchee, you're up!

I agree with Fetch the Bolt Cutters being the best. Atop my personal list is "Shore" -- so good! I would also like to shout out Bright Eyes, Hamilton Leithauser, the Killers, My Morning Jacket (really disappointed not to see this in Gum's top 50 -- c'mon guys!), and Tame Impala for releasing albums that got me through this year.

And last but not least, I must mention - Save Stereogum: An '00s Cover Compilation was totally snubbed!

I was just thinking yesterday about how this season is gonna be the year of seeing Fiona Apple, Waxahatchee, Phoebe Bridgers, RTJ4, and Taylor Swift over and over again, and lo behold, 4 out of 5. Not that it's underserved in any case (well, folklore runs kinda long, IMO), but the homogenization is real.

Weird year for music! Felt like a lot of great albums but few clear front runners (other than Fetch The Bolt Cutters, which is an amazing album, but which IMO definitely benefited from its release timing).

One of my favorite albums that didn’t make this list is Oceanator (although to be fair, I only discovered them through the new band list a few weeks ago, so credit to the Gum where it’s due). Goddamn, “I Would Find You” might be my song of the year. Charli asked for anthems to soundtrack the apocalypse, and Oceanator delivered: “If the world fell apart tomorrow / I would find you / I would come for you.” While it’s a broad song—it could be about romantic love, friendship, family, or even solidarity—it also perfectly captures that March 2020 feeling of being stuck inside your apartment all day, only going out once at 10 PM for a walk after the streets have cleared out. Sonically, it’s kind of like wholesome Joy Division (although the rest of the album is more 90s rock revival).

And if all that doesn’t convince you, Oceanator also has a split covers EP with Bartees Strange called “Tear The Fascists Down” (!!).

Listed a lot more albums on Twitter (@DjPadfoot , I’m private for work reasons but feel free to send me a request), but most of them are propped up by the rest of you lovely music nerds.

I also just want to say thanks to everyone here. Scott for keeping the lights on. The regular writers for keeping that sweet, sweet, distracting content flowing. The other guest writers for going long on cool shit I’ve either never heard before (Soul Glo y’all), or can’t stop listening to already and am desperately consuming every word on the internet about. The commenters for being fun to argue with about trivial things like new music during a global pandemic. My wife for never reading what I post here. And everyone who donated more than $20 during the pledge drive so I didn’t have to convince my wife to let me drop $100 while we were both between jobs during said global pandemic. And blochead for being too old to fix his avatar.

Like a lot of people, I listened to music differently this year. Sometimes I listened to a lot more, just needing to fill time and silence, but in a way that could feel compulsive or joyless. Sometimes music lost its flavor for weeks at a time and I just listened to podcasts instead. But the music that broke through the funk and connected with me was the music that engaged and reflected my restlessness and anxiety rather than trying too soothe it. Even "Saint Cloud," the closest think to a soothing record here, plays to me like the sound of hard-won contentment and even the way it renders the bliss of partnership is cut with anxiety ("Can't Do Much"). Fiona Apple's instant classic of an album makes that itching for liberation central from the title track on down, and it plays self-sufficiency less like an ideology than a defensive adaptation, learning to make music from the sound of driving yourself up the walls. Moses Sumney's Grae takes on the idea of being "islanded" (isolated) in a similarly sprawling manner, its kaleidoscope of moods and sounds reflecting the moment where your inner monologue is so scattered and loud that its starts to become a weird kind of dialogue. Fitting for an album that dwelled on "multiplicity," it has three of the best songs of the year - Cut Me, Virile, and especially the devastating Me in 20 Years - that sound nothing like each other.

That's also what kept me coming back to my favorite album of the year, Set My Heart on Fire Immediately. Despite spending most of every single day, week, month in the same 1100 sq ft apartment, this was an album that helped me to find universes of imagination and feeling, which helped me keep passion and creativity in my life, and which also was just the most compulsively replayable, alluring, and rewarding batch of songs I heard all year. Mike has made a few records I've loved now, but none that set my heart on fire quite like this one.

Beautifully written. I know we went back and forth about the Perfume Genius album before, but let me just say this: Despite not really loving the album like that, what made me warm up to it considerably is realizing just how weird it is ("Moonbend" did the trick). A lot of the coverage around it focussed on how Mike was at a much better place mentally and willing to take on all kinds of (musical) challenges, and in the wake of that it is easy to overlook that these songs are often times incredibly lonely, sad and twisted (also heartfelt and beautiful). And in a way I appreciate that. The album's not my favorite in his discography, but it is a grower and who knows where it might end up?

Also "I know you called me and I didn't pick up, I was busy freaking out" is already an instant classic line/musical moment from Mike.

I feel like I've been more distracted than usual this year, still a bunch of albums I'd like to spend more time with, and I'm looking forward to finding the stuff I've overlooked completely this year.

I like the stuff Phoebe Bridgers has done before this year but maybe didn't love it, although I do love the title Stranger in the Alps. So I was optimistic about Punisher, but it completely blew me away and was exactly the album I needed this year.

padfoot24
Same re: Phoebe. I’ve been a fan of her non-boygenius stuff from a distance, but Punisher was just the perfect blend of self-lacerating wit, gentle psychadelia, and sincere absurdity that kept me feeling positive when 2020 was trying it’s best to keep me focused on hopelessness.

Can’t really argue with much here - RTJ, Fiona and Phoebe were early winners for me but Bob Mould, Deftones and Sylvan Esso were my favourites that didn’t make the top 50 that came out later in the year.

Also, for anyone who was disappointed by the last Slearer Kinney album, don’t sleep on the Cable Ties record - definitely scratches that itch. What a great year for music in a bad year for living.

One light in a shit year was Bandcamp Friday. I was lucky enough to work from home this year, and being unable to go to bars meant lots of extra money that I could spend on stuff like Light In The Attic reissues, The Storehouse Bandcamp Comp, and albums from smaller artists who could definitely use it and who were often introduced to me by this site (shout out to Little Kid). It was also a good year to get really into artists (Neil Young, Joni Mitchell) and genres (American Primitive) that I knew I liked but hadn’t fully plumbed the depths of their discographies. I now have strong Jaco Pastorius and also Kottke opinions! I want you all to have better years than this one, and I want Big Thief to reschedule their show at The National.

This year I didn’t try to think of music within a list-context, I just collected releases that I liked and ended up with 43 albums. Organizing them into a list feels kinda wrong, or at least significantly harder than it used to be for the past few years. I think I like it that way, keeps me on my toes. Lists are fun but they somewhat simplify all the kinds of emotions one can have towards music.

ANYWAY since I still want to revel in music discussion with y’all, here are six album that I’m super sure of:

1. Nicolas Jaar - Telas
Constantly building and falling apart, this album created such a wonderful space for me. Hints of Jazz and electronic music are faintly present, but everything that happens in this hour feels new and inspiring and fresh. What a record.

2. Arca - kick i
So fierce, precise, rough, catchy.

3. Moses Sumney - græ
The song cycle that kept on giving. Beautifully woven, intricate instrumentation, vocals to die for (also: packaging oty).

4. Kate NV - Room For the Moon
Unfolding with a childlike warmth and joy, yet undoubtedly melancholic, yet not nostalgic. Atmospheric, too. Opens up a strange room that is not quite past and not quite present, and lets the moon in.

5. Four Tet - Sixteen Oceans
This album sounds like a blast of sunshine and warm air.

6. Wren Dove Lark – ODDBIRD
I'm biased, I'll admit that. But these songs haven't left my mind this year, and nor have the strange creatures and weird colors they conjure up. Future druid AOTY.

Here are 14 more that stayed with me, but that I can’t rank for now:

Charli XCX – how I’m feeling now
Jónsi – Shiver
The Microphones – Microphones in 2020
Rina Sawayama – Sawayama
Adrianne Lenker – songs
Autechre – PLUS/SIGN
Annie – Dark Hearts
Eartheater – Phoenix: Flames Are Dew Upon My Skin
Meitei – Kofu
Open Mike Eagle – Anime, Trauma & Divorce
Yves Tumor – Heaven to a Tortured Mind
Haru Nemuri – Lovetheism
Oranssi Pazuzu– Mestarin Kynsi
Holly Childs & Gediminas Žygus – Hydrangea

Favorite EP:
Christine & the Queens – La Vita Nuova (and it’s not even close).

Happy listmas everybody. I was not ready to do this at all. I will look at your lists now.

I haven’t even thought about my list yet. It’ll probably be early 2021 in classic me fashion before I have one ready. It’ll definitely have folklore, punisher, fetch the bolt cutters, untitled (rise), peaceful as hell, mydata, (obv I’m biased here) pain mop girl 2020, and fires in heaven on it.

I think my bigger priority is I’m going to spend some energy in December collecting my favorite albums/songs of 2020 from artists who would never be included in a list like this and making a twitter thread talking about it. So if peeps are interested, stay tuned on Twitter haha

I feel like I was disappointed by a lot of the new records by favorites that I was looking forward to (Jason Isbell, Margo Price both come to mind, not that either were bad records but they weren't what I wanted from either of them) and obviously it was a somewhat quiet year overall in terms of new stuff, I 'liked' plenty but didn't love a lot. So the stuff I loved:

Modern Nature - Annual
Colter Wall - Western Swing & Waltzes
Jackie Lynn - Jacqueline
The 1975 - Notes On A Conditional Form
Taylor Swift - Folklore
Mosses- TV Sun
Courtney Marie Andrews - Old Flowers
William Tyler - New Vanitas
Shirley Collins - Heart’s Ease
Nine Inch Nails - Ghosts V/VI
Fleet Foxes - Shore
Jennifer Castle - Monarch Season

Plus I’m not sure whether or not all of the Gillian Welch/Dave Rawlings records count since they’re all archival? I'm sure I'm forgetting stuff too...

This suffers from a huge lack of country by the way. No Becky Warren, or Jesse Daniel, or Arlo McKinley. Instead, a somewhat subpar Jason Isbell though still very good and Sam Hunt. Honestly best of lists almost always have to leave things out, but that is a big gap at least for me.

Country is under-covered here and the kind that does get picked up is either alt-country "americana" a la Jason Isbell or country in name only a la sam hunt where the writer spends the entire article regurgitating the press release describing it as "drake-influenced" and "innovative."

I don't have them in my Top 10, but I'd certainly place for them in the 10-20 range as well.

Yeah man! They aren't blowing anyone's minds, but they are out there doing their thing, and I find that comforting enough to have given this album a ton of listens this year.

Did Grimes get deducted points for her baby-naming shenanigans or other very public foot-in-mouthisms?

I'm really surprised Miss Anthopocene wasn't listed -- a great album all around!

12/1/20 11:23 AM0REPLY

compuff
Miss Anthro left me kinda cold. It has a solid run through the middle, but it felt like Grimes' adventurousness calcified in an uninteresting kind of way. Felt like an album that wasn't created as much as it was turned in, IMO.

12/1/20 12:58 PM0REPLY

sleepyheadphone
This is a very personal thing, but her whole obsession with dystopian cyberpunk turned me off a lot. Plus the whole Elon Musk situation kinda bled into all of that, and it ended up being a rather uncomfortable listen for me. That and I'm not the biggest nu-metal fan, so she lost points in that department as well.

I don't think it's a bad record though, my hangups with it are mostly due to personal preference.

The William Basinski album was a pretty beautiful listen. And Silver Ladders! Almost forgot about that one but it arrived at such a distinct point in the year that it already takes me back even though it's only been a few months.

Also, I haven't really checked out Aesop Rock yet, need to do that aesap

12/1/20 11:54 AM+3REPLY

antigone
I don't know how Bill keeps doing it, but some of those tracks are among the most beautiful he's ever made, which is saying something! And "Silver Ladders" is as much a balm as it is a record, and surely her best work yet; "Til A Mermaid Drags You Under" is capital T transcendent. The Aes record is really great; he's just so consistent its almost mind-bending. SWFG is probably already a Top 5 release from him for me, get on it!

12/1/20 12:08 PM+1REPLY

sleepyheadphone
Something about Silver Ladders constantly draws me back in. It has, much like the Kate NV record, such a strong moody presence. I love that about it. And yes, very soothing.

And yeah, Lamentations is somehow among his best. It's like a Eluvium/Caretaker crossover, and I just dig those tones so much.

Sturgill Simpson - Cutting Grass Vol. 1
Deftones - Ohms
Phoebe Bridgers - Punisher
The 1975 - notes on a Conditional Form
Bonny Horse Lightman

Rolling Stones - Goat Head Soup
The Band - Music from Big pink
Marilyn Manson - Antichrist Superstar
Oasis - Whats the Story (Morning Glory)

And now listening to Kate NV that I heard of from this list. It's really amazing.

Marigold is really really good. It got a lil bit pre-pandemic memory-holed, but the best songs on it complex and heartfelt in a way that blends the punchier Cardinal and more reflective Skylight really well.

12/1/20 12:03 PM+6REPLY

Novemberists
I liked it but there are more weaker songs on there than their other albums. The title track at the end is irrelevant and I find No Drugs or Alcohol to be cloying/annoying.

I listened to Dotted Line more than just about any other song this year though so it's still a solid album.

12/1/20 1:14 PM+1REPLY

Disappyramid
I'll give you the title track....there could've been a bit more to that one, even on the instrumental side.

But songs like The Alarmist, Moment and Endless are nicely fleshed out in comparison to some of the earlier work. Overall, their recording/production sounds stronger.

Caught me off guard, here’s my top 10 + some HM’s that didn’t/don’t get mentioned enough:

1. Grimes - Miss Anthropocene (started at 1 and never wavered, my fav Grimes album yet)
2. Boldy James - Price of Tea in China
3. Ella Minus - acts of rebellion (best discovery)
4. Infant Island - Beneath (kept climbing up as the year went on)
5. Empty Country - S/T
6. RTJ4
7. Phoebe Bridgers - Punisher
8. Kelly Lee Owens - Inner Song
9. Eve Owen - Don’t Let the Ink Dry (another gorgeous album that kept getting better)
10. Record Setter - I Owe You Nothing (maybe would’ve been higher had it come out sooner)

HMs:
Loathe - I let it in and it took everything
Deserta - Black Aura my Sun
Jesu - Terminus
Purity Ring - WOMB
Hannah Georgas - all that emotion (what a fucking year for Aaron Dessner)
Ellis - Born Again

IDK if I'm ready to say I like Miss Anthropocene more than Art Angels quite yet, but it already feels like the essential Grimes album to me. The whole ethereal techno metal cyberpunk vibe sounds like something she's been working her way to all along, very much in keeping with her visual aesthetic and her extracurricular interests. "My Name is Dark" and "Delete Forever" and "Idoru" go straight to the Grimes Hall of Fame, probably "4AEM" too.

12/1/20 12:04 PM+1REPLY

toxotoxotoxotoxo
Delete Forever might be my SOTY idk if she’s ever made a better track (I know I know Oblivion and Genesis exist) than that. I was ready to hate Miss Anthropocene because of her constant antics but on the extreme contrary....I’d also throw in Darkseid to your list goddamn that song goes so hard.

My 2020 list is kind of a grab bag that reflects the scattershot way the the year went. I fell back on playlists filled with old punk and 70s tunes that I'd ignored my entire life. Frequent listens from 2020 are maybe not the best, but whatever:

- Fiona Apple, Fetch the Bolt Cutters
- Serengeti, Akai
- Fleet Foxes, Shore

6. Bananagun - The True Story of Bananagun
7. Pearl Jam - Gigaton (that's right, fuck off)
8. Boldy James - The Price of Tea in China (Manger on McNichols over this is such a lame take)
9. Black Thoughts - Streams of Thought 3 (but...but..they had Portugal the Man on there, it must suck!)

18. Shabazz Palaces - The Don of Diamond Dreams
19. Stephen Malkmus - Traditional techniques
20. SAULT - Untitled (Black Is)

Archival/live/etc stuff that would absolutely make my Top 25:

Sylvan Esso - WITH (the new studio album almost made my list - it has a few of my favorite songs this year - but this beefed-up live surprise was a real gem)
Neil Young - Homegrown (come on, peak-era NY)
Sturgill Simpson - Cuttin' Grass V1
DARKSIDE - Psychic Live July 17 2014
Tom Petty - Wildflowers & All the Rest

I said Sylvan Esso's Free Love had a few high-end tracks ("Train", "Rooftop Dancing, and to a slightly lesser extent "Numb" and "Ferris Wheel) on it but didn't make the album list I shared; that's true of Khruangbin as well. "So We Won't Forget" is my favorite song of the year and the other two early singles are up there, too (+ "Texas Sun" w/Leon Bridges, but that track technically appeared late last year).

Lmao sam hunt

Anyway i did not realize this list was coming so soon so i dont really have one ahh!! All i know for sure is:

Waxahatchee is my album of the year, with fleet foxes in a close second and thundercat in a close third

But i set a personal record for new albums listened to in a year in 2020 (something between 80 and 95 new releases) so its tough to sift through, some assorted faves in no real order were:
-tennis: swimmer
-freddie: alfredo
-caroline rose: superstar (that one turned out to be a grower)
-caribou: suddenly
-real estate: the main thing
-rap ferreira: purple moonlight pages
-future islands: as long as you are
-hamilton leithauser: the loves of your life
-khruangbin: mordechai
-boldy james: the price of tea in china
-madeline kinney: suckers lunch
-no joy: motherhood
-anjimile: giver taker
-open mike eagle: anime trauma and divorce
-bartees strange: live forever

As good a year for new music as it was bad a year for everything else!

It feels impossible to put this list in any semblance of order, so I won’t. A banner year for music if nothing else. Also, looking up the release dates for each of these has sent me into an existential crisis. You’ll see what I mean.

Ireland and Colombia won the year. Róisín Machine, seemingly out of nowhere, may be my favorite album of the year, with A Hero’s Death close behind. My top 20, kinda:

envy - The Fallen Crimson (February)
Ka - Descendants of Cain (May)
Bad Bunny - YHQLMDLG (February)
Yaeji - WHAT WE DREW (April)
Chloe x Halle - Ungodly Hour (June)
Deeper - Auto-Pain (March)
Dua Lipa - Future Nostalgia (March)
Shabazz Palaces - The Don of Diamond Dreams (April)
Lido Pimienta - Miss Colombia (April)
Gia Margaret - Mia Gargaret (June)
Jessie Ware - What’s Your Pleasure? (June)
Silverbacks - Fad (July)
Fontaines D.C. - A Hero's Death (July)
Destroyer - Have We Met (January)
GoGo Penguin - GoGo Penguin (June)
Róisín Murphy - Róisín Machine (October)
Open Mike Eagle - Anime, Trauma and Divorce (October)
Ela Minus - acts of rebellion (October)
Ghetto Kumbé - Ghetto Kumbé (May)
MOURN - Self Worth (October)

Stay safe, Stereogum.

Maybe it's just the effect of this awful year but I haven't connected with too many new releases in 2020 — worried it's a sign I'm getting old!

The order isn't so important here but here's what I liked:
1) Destroyer (most surprising omission for me!)
2) Bob Dylan (can't believe he still had a great one in him)
3) Freddie Gibbs & Alchemist
4) Autechre
5) Adrienne Lenker
6) Fontaines DC
7) Actress (electronic needs more coverage on the Gum!)
8) Tame Impala (underrated)
9) Caribou
10) SAULT

Still need to listen to Onehotrix and Thundercat. I'll probably like them a lot knowing me...

10. Westerman
9. Fiona Apple
8. Destroyer
7. Tame Impala
6. Future Islands (as I wrote in a comment above I think they are getting tragically overlooked as a result of having Spoon/Beach House levels of consistency)
5. Young Jesus

2. Moses Sumney
1. Perfume Genius

Other favorites:
Nation of Language
RTJ4
Sylvan Esso - WITH

Hayley Williams

Waxahatchee
Sufjan
Yves Tumor

and finally, perhaps most importantly, 2020 SONIC WARM BLANKET RECORDS:

Four Tet
Trace Mountains
Adrienne Lenker
Fleet Foxes
Peel Dream Magazine
Khruangbin
(Perfume Genius and Westerman played a huge role here as well, but I already put them in my "real" ranking lol)

This is what I put on whenever I needed to relieve endless amounts of anxiety that I'm sure you all experienced in one way or another as well, and in many ways this will be the music that I actually associate with 202 in my brain for the future. I would not have made it through the year without all of this incredible music to keep me swaddled

Just a gentle reminder to everyone to please support the musicians on your respective lists any way you can. Buy albums, merch, whatever. If you stream albums for convenience that's fine but remember that it does virtually nothing to support most musicians. I generally prefer unranked lists but I do want to be included in the all-important Stereogum commenter tally so I've stuck numbers in front of these. They could go in almost any order, though--it's all good.

1. Leo Takami - Felis Catus and Silence
2. Waxahatchee - Saint Cloud
3. Nap Eyes - Snapshot of a Beginner
4. Jeff Parker - Suite for Max Brown
5. Hum - Inlet
6. Mike Polizze - Long Lost Solace Find
7. Sally Anne Morgan - Thread
8. Adrienne Lenker - songs
9. John Lee Shannon - In and Of
10. H. C. McIntire - Eno Axis
11.Terry Allen - Just Like Moby Dick
12. Alabaster DePlume - To Cy and Lee, Instrumentals Vol. 1
13. Stephen Malkmus - Traditional Techniques
14. Bob Dylan - Rough and Rowdy Ways
15. Mary Lattimore - Silver Ladders
16. James Elkington - Ever-Roving Eye
17. Destroyer - Have We Met
18. Jennifer Castle - Monarch Season
19. Run the Jewels - RTJ4
20. Brigid Mae Power - Head Above the Water
21. Fiona Apple - Fetch the Bolt Cutters
22. Green-House - Six Songs for Invisible Gardens
23. Josh Kimbrough - Slither, Soar & Disappear
24. Ezra Feinberg - Recumbent Speech
25. Gwenifer Raymond - Strange Lights Over Garth Mountain

I also loved the music that Bill Callahan, Kevin Morby, William Tyler, Channelers, Gunn-Truscinski Duo, Jeff Tweedy, Sarah Louise, Nathan Salsburg, Makaya McCraven, and WOODS, among others, put out in the world this year.

I listened to so much new music this year and so much of it was great that I've had a real hard time getting it down to a manageable list, but here goes nothing. A top 25 in sort of an order but not really:

2. Jeff Rosenstock - NO DREAM
3. Hum - Inlet
4. Gulch - Impenetrable Cerebral Fortress
5. Fiona Apple - Fetch the Bolt Cutters

13. Dogleg - Melee
14. Pallbearer - Forgotten Days
15. Moor Mother - Circuit City

19. Yves Tumor - Heaven To A Tortured Mind
20. Freddie Gibbs & The Alchemist - Alfredo

21. Oranssi Pazuzu - Mestarin kynsi
22. Black Dresses - Peaceful As Hell
23. Chubby & The Gang - Speed Kills
24. ERR & Thou - May Our Chambers Be Full
25. Kaatayra - Toda História pela Frente

I'm sure I missed a lot of stuff I really liked (Barely Civil, Destroyer, Dropdead, Dan Deacon come to mind immediately, but my list would be 100 albums long if I kept going.)

What a great year for new music releases, all things considered. I hope 2021 is even better, hopefully with the ability to see some shows added in for good measure.

I’m super bummed Love is the King got no love anywhere.
Personally I feel it’s better than Warm which was one of my favorite albums from 2018. Love is the King is such comfort music for me and I thought it would at least get some mention somewhere. Jeff Tweedy is a National Treasure! With the reissue of Summerteeth and this one I’ve been in a Tweedy cocoon this last month and it’s been very healing.

For me, 2018 and 2019 were fairly weak for music (with some obvious exceptions). I usually make a list of the best 25 albums of the year, and it was a struggle for me to fill it out those years without reaching. 2020 was exceptional though. Could easily make a top 50 that I feel good about.

Aw man I was NOT ready for this. I have FOMO, and after close to 500 comments this is just another pitiable soul howling into the abyss, but I'd still like to contribute my draft top albums list. I spent a lot of time on 'Gum this year and your list is excellent, and mine probably reflects is.

1. Sault, Untitled (Black Is)
2. Autechre, PLUS/SIGN
3. Fiona Apple, Fetch the Bolt Cutters
4. Run the Jewels, RTJ4
5. Actress, Karma & Desire
6. SW., TRUElipS
7. Moses Sumney, grae
8. Yves Tumor, Heaven to a Tortured Mind
9. Jessie Ware, What's Your Pleasure?
10. Boldy James, The Price of Tea in China
11. Lady Gaga, Chromatica
12. Nazar, Guerilla
13. Tunes of Negation, Like the Stars Forever and Ever
14. Nine Inch Nails, Ghosts V / VI
15. Boris, NO
16. Rina Sawayama, SAWAYAMA
17. Moodymann, Taken Away
18. Krust, The Edge of Everything
19. Fleet Foxes, Shore
20. Spectral Lore/Mare Incognitum, Wanderers

Special love to 925, Kylie Minogue, Young Jesus, Lil Uzi Vert, Bully, Bob Dylan, Dua Lipa, Perfume Genius, Sada Baby, Backxwash, Nicolas Jaar, Shabazz Palaces, Rival Consoles, Call Super, Annie, Soccer Mommy, et al for keeping a less-than-great year so interesting musically. I will finalize my list in a couple of weeks, but well done Stereogum.

I couldn't bring myself to exclude any one of these albums from this comment, so here's my Top 11 albums of 2020:

01. Taylor Swift - Folklore
02. Perfume Genius - Set My Heart On Fire Immediately
03. Moses Sumney - Grae
04. The Strokes - The New Abnormal
05. Charli XCX - How I'm Feeling Now
06. Sufjan Stevens - The Ascension
07. Hayley Williams - Petals For Armor
08. The Weeknd - After Hours
09. Grimes - Miss_Anthropocene
10. Phoebe Bridgers - Punisher
11. Run The Jewels - Run The Jewels 4

--- (some additional thoughts on this set of albums) ---

You could place any one of the top 3 albums on #1 here, and I would sign off on that list. Just all absolute smashers and early AOTD contenders.

I hope everyone remembers the way this Strokes album was treated this year when they release the next album. Because crimes were committed here and we need to respect motherfucking craft when we see it.

Hayley Williams released the most underrated album of the year, and Charli released the most effortless modern pop classic of the year.

Please dont @ me about The Weeknd, I dont know what happened! one minute I was jamming to Blinding Lights and before i could really think about it, i was just jamming that hard to the entire album. I can't quite completely explain it, I don't know if this will hold up, but the weeknd made my most played album of the year.

I am nothing if not loyal once i fall for an artist, and Sufjan, Grimes and RTJ all made applause worthy comebacks, and so I must continue to stan.

And Phoebe Bridgers just has my whole entire heart

20 of my 2020 (so far). Not in any real order, I'm just numbering them to limit myself to a reasonable amount.

1. Fetch the Bolt Cutters - Fiona Apple (2020). She's always been a bit of a slow burner for me as a listener, but this just knocked my socks clean off from the first. Even better, it keeps getting richer the more I listen to it. A perfectly formed sonic world to retreat into during an especially insular year. Cozy and unfamiliar.

2. Don Juan's Reckless Daughter - Joni Mitchell (1977). I got super into Joni a couple years back after nonstop listening to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly (which just reminded me a lot of her music). I was a huge fan but only of a limited number of LPs, and I ended up stretching into a lot of records I'd avoided or dismissed. Don Juan's Reckless Daughter was one of the last to really get my attention, mainly because it's one of her worst reviewed and the cover has her in blackface (which really hurts). Fuck, this album is incredible. It's become my favorite album of hers.

3. Perfection & Permanence (2014) and Kainskult (2017) - Trepaneringsritualen. These albums are mammoth and I love them and they've opened up new avenues for me personally and musically.

4. græ - Moses Sumney (2020). Just a hugely cinematic listening experience. Which conjures up images of big-budget, wide open vistas full of color and detail and movement and air and it has all that, absolutely, but it's also cinematic in terms of the films of Robert Bresson or Agnès Varda or Julie Dash or Derek Jarman. It's the kind of album that makes me want to learn more.

5. La vita nuova EP - Christine and the Queens (2020). Pure pleasure.

6. Grave of a Dog - Sightless Pit (2020).

7. Look Alive - The Stroppies (2020).

8. ALFREDO - Freddie Gibbs and The Alchemist (2020).

9. Impossible Princess (1997) and DISCO (2020) - Kylie Minogue. To be perfectly honest, I'm still processing the new one. For me, there tends to be three kinds of Kylie albums: the pick 'n mix, where a variety of approaches are explored (Light Years, X, Kiss Me Once), the thematic album, where there's a lyrical journey and a musical vibe perfectly locked in sync (Aphrodite, Body Language, Impossible Princess), and the concept album, where it's one idea expressed cleanly across the board (Fever, Kylie Minogue). Occasionally an album can slot neatly into two columns (Golden is thematic and concept, especially in it's "deluxe edition" tracklist). DISCO seems to land squarely in the concept column, which is usually the least interesting option. Still sussing out the hidden ingredients in the flavor profile, but it's delicious nonetheless.

10. Times of Grace- Neurosis (1999).

11. Modus Vivendi - 070 Shake (2020). Why wasn't this album, like, reasonably huge? It even seems to have escaped the kind of media praise it fully deserves, far as I can tell. If COVID hadn't thwarted her tour with The (ugh) 1975, I think we'd be seeing this on more End of Year lists.

12. KiCk i - Arca (2020). Hyper. Sexy. And hyper//sexy.

13. Two Creation Myths - The Native Cats (2020).

14. Forever Gold - Dionne Warwicke (1973). A fundamental album in my musical upbringing, this compilation is absolutely totemic for me. I found a sealed copy on eBay, so I splurged and treated myself (with fifteen bucks of my pandemic relief check!). Totally worth it, obvi.

15. Live Forever - Bartees Strange (2020).

16. Underground - Thelonious Monk (1968).

17. Go Tell the Fox (sampler) - Jim Ferguson (2020). Oh, the fucking ego. This is a set of tracks I made scoring an imaginary film. I actually enjoy it, and will listen to it on purpose, for pleasure.

18. The Next Day - David Bowie (2013).

19. Rough and Rowdy Ways - Bob Dylan (2020).

20. Second Childhood - Phoebe Snow (1976).

There's more, of course. There's always more. But that's enough.
