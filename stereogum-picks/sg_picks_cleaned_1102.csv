"
1882,"20 of my 2020 (so far). Not in any real order, I'm just numbering them to limit myself to a reasonable amount.
"
1883,"1. Fetch the Bolt Cutters - Fiona Apple (2020). She's always been a bit of a slow burner for me as a listener, but this just knocked my socks clean off from the first. Even better, it keeps getting richer the more I listen to it. A perfectly formed sonic world to retreat into during an especially insular year. Cozy and unfamiliar.
"
1884,"2. Don Juan's Reckless Daughter - Joni Mitchell (1977). I got super into Joni a couple years back after nonstop listening to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly (which just reminded me a lot of her music). I was a huge fan but only of a limited number of LPs, and I ended up stretching into a lot of records I'd avoided or dismissed. Don Juan's Reckless Daughter was one of the last to really get my attention, mainly because it's one of her worst reviewed and the cover has her in blackface (which really hurts). Fuck, this album is incredible. It's become my favorite album of hers.
"
1885,"3. Perfection & Permanence (2014) and Kainskult (2017) - Trepaneringsritualen. These albums are mammoth and I love them and they've opened up new avenues for me personally and musically.
"
1886,"4. græ - Moses Sumney (2020). Just a hugely cinematic listening experience. Which conjures up images of big-budget, wide open vistas full of color and detail and movement and air and it has all that, absolutely, but it's also cinematic in terms of the films of Robert Bresson or Agnès Varda or Julie Dash or Derek Jarman. It's the kind of album that makes me want to learn more.
"
1887,"5. La vita nuova EP - Christine and the Queens (2020). Pure pleasure.
"
1888,"6. Grave of a Dog - Sightless Pit (2020).
"
1889,"7. Look Alive - The Stroppies (2020).
"
1890,"8. ALFREDO - Freddie Gibbs and The Alchemist (2020).
"
1891,"9. Impossible Princess (1997) and DISCO (2020) - Kylie Minogue. To be perfectly honest, I'm still processing the new one. For me, there tends to be three kinds of Kylie albums: the pick 'n mix, where a variety of approaches are explored (Light Years, X, Kiss Me Once), the thematic album, where there's a lyrical journey and a musical vibe perfectly locked in sync (Aphrodite, Body Language, Impossible Princess), and the concept album, where it's one idea expressed cleanly across the board (Fever, Kylie Minogue). Occasionally an album can slot neatly into two columns (Golden is thematic and concept, especially in it's ""deluxe edition"" tracklist). DISCO seems to land squarely in the concept column, which is usually the least interesting option. Still sussing out the hidden ingredients in the flavor profile, but it's delicious nonetheless.
"
1892,"10. Times of Grace- Neurosis (1999).
"
1893,"11. Modus Vivendi - 070 Shake (2020). Why wasn't this album, like, reasonably huge? It even seems to have escaped the kind of media praise it fully deserves, far as I can tell. If COVID hadn't thwarted her tour with The (ugh) 1975, I think we'd be seeing this on more End of Year lists.
"
1894,"12. KiCk i - Arca (2020). Hyper. Sexy. And hyper//sexy.
"
1895,"13. Two Creation Myths - The Native Cats (2020).
"
1896,"14. Forever Gold - Dionne Warwicke (1973). A fundamental album in my musical upbringing, this compilation is absolutely totemic for me. I found a sealed copy on eBay, so I splurged and treated myself (with fifteen bucks of my pandemic relief check!). Totally worth it, obvi.
"
1897,"15. Live Forever - Bartees Strange (2020).
"
1898,"16. Underground - Thelonious Monk (1968).
"
1899,"17. Go Tell the Fox (sampler) - Jim Ferguson (2020). Oh, the fucking ego. This is a set of tracks I made scoring an imaginary film. I actually enjoy it, and will listen to it on purpose, for pleasure.
