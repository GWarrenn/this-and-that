My favorite 2020 memory was driving on a farm road in Texas listening to Pure X this summer. Perfect blue skies. Vivid green grass from all the rain that preceded July. Driving on a recently paved black road so fresh it didn’t even have yellow lines. I passed more cows than cars on my way to visit an old friend. All the while, the Texas natives Pure X soundtracked a scenery that was likely similar to what inspired the music (just look at that blue album cover). I had already listened to the new Pure X dozens of times, so the marriage of the visuals and audio really helped pull me out of the reality that I had previously been stuck in my home for months. It felt like freedom that afternoon.

But Yves Tumor is an ascendent rockstar that made a perfect album and we need to herald them as such.

Ugh, you're a villain for hearing the new Avalanches before the rest of us.

Love your list! I thought the new Tame Impala was super slept-on, it did such a good job of navigating more emotionally complex situations than the heartbreak of Currents, while also sounding like several different eras of pop music blended together on like every song. And the Against All Logic album was a fittingly jagged soundtrack for this roughshod year, "If You Can't Do It Good Do It Hard" is SOTY IMO.

12/1/20 10:34 AM+17REPLY

raptor jesus
Actually I'm a villain for putting it on my list WITHOUT having heard it. I figured I've heard enough pre-singles and have enough faith in the Avalanches that it was deserving of a spot regardless. Especially if it HAD actually just been released, I would gladly let the recency bias shoot it up super high on the list without thinking much about it.

Now THAT'S a premature evaluation.

I'm sure everyone has a joke of WHY Tame Impala was "slept-on," but all my friends love Tame Impala so it was the natural go to pick for summer 2020. I think it's a much tighter release than Currents and still has a wealth of great songs.

I was playing "If You Can't Do It Good Do It Hard" and during the first half, my friend asked what the fuck I was playing. When Lydia started yelling, he shut the fuck up so fast. Such a powerful track.

TONS I haven't heard yet, but here's my top, let's say 25, as of Dec. 1.

1. Waxahatchee - Saint Cloud
2. Jessie Ware - What's Your Pleasure?
3. Oranssi Pazuzu - Mestarin Kynsi

That's three 10s off the top. Those things are hard to call the year of, but I couldn't deny them. What's most astonishing is that with two of the artists, I never really cared for their work previous, and with the third - Waxahatchee - I enjoyed, but assumed had a lower ceiling. She shattered it with this one.

4. RTJ - RTJ4
5. Pinegrove - Marigold (sorry, I still roll with Pinegrove)
6. Jeff Rosenstock - No Dream
7. Gulch - Impenetrable Cerebral Fortress
8. Westside Gunn - WHO MADE THE SUNSHINE (West's best)
9. Jeff Parker - Suite For Max Brown
10. Ben Seretan - Youth Pastoral
11. Daniel Romano - "How Ill Thy World Is Formed"
12. Potion - Cemetary EP (just heard it yesterday, but what the hell, I'm putting it here)
13. Lydia Loveless - Daughter (the best Neko Case album not made by Neko Case)
14. 2nd Grade - Hit To Hit
15. Jay Electronica - A Written Testimony
16. Code Orange - Underneath (so wonderfully dumb)
17. CHIKA - INDUSTRY GAMES
18. Adrianne Lenker - songs/instrumentals
19. Coriky - Coriky
20. DRAIN - California Cursed
21. Those Dirty Projectors EPs
22. Elder - Omens (the vocals are meh, but man the band do some incredible things here)
23. Mil-Spec - World House (a nice space filler when waiting for a new Propagandhi)
24. Sam Hunt - SOUTHSIDE (sometimes I love it)
25. Fiona Apple - Fetch The Bolt Cutters (Fiona never came naturally to me...I'm still working on it).

I appreciate the Pinegrove love! Marigold is easily their most cohesive batch of new songs yet, not simply re-works of their pre-Cardinal catalog. I'm looking forward to what Evan, Zac and crew have in store for the future. If you haven't checked it out, Megan's new album 'Tender Kid' as Chuck Is A Band is a good quick indie rock ripper. Sam Skinner also has a new album coming out in the new year to look forward to. Quite the creative bunch!

12/1/20 12:53 PM+12REPLY

HartfordTheWhale
Pinegrove is still great, Marigold is great (but needed 3 more songs to be in any AOTY convo) and it's been pretty well established that the whole "controversy" was pretty much a messy emo relationship thing that didn't really need to be public and certainly shouldn't have caused the problems it did. I really hope they continue releasing music and everyone moves on from the bullshit because Evan is a supremely talented songwriter and seems like a solid guy who's done a good deal of introspection and public atonement despite the dubious nature of the accusation.

12/1/20 4:37 PM+12REPLY

A solid album by Lydia Loveless. Pop music but with the same lyrical honesty and vocal grit that we're accustomed to from her. A lot of pressure has been placed on her by people who want her to be some kind of country or alt-country savior. This record seems to move beyond that. The bright sound of the production fits her vocals to a tee. In my opinion, "When You're Gone" is the best thing she's ever cut. If this release, and especially that song, signifies a new direction then I'm all-in. As usual, great chemistry between Lydia's vocals and Todd May's tasteful guitar work. I love May's solo album from 2013 and hope he makes another. As for 'Daughter,' your mention of it may have screwed up my Top 10. It came close to making the cut and perhaps should have.

12/1/20 4:16 PM+3REPLY

HartfordTheWhale
Daughter is really good but I think it lacks the punch of her previous two releases. I'd put it ahead of her debut, Real remains the high watermark for me. She's a terrific songwriter though.

'Welcome to Conceptual Beach' is a solid reinterpretation of Young Jesus's sound. While I liked the classic mid-aughts emo of their earlier albums, the almost-jams and complex arrangements are so good, every time it's popped into my head I have to listen to the album front to back.

12/1/20 10:10 AM+18REPLY

mr. gruff the atheist goat
Like our raptor friend, most of the new music I listened to were the hotly anticipated new albums from old favorites. But there were some surprises!
Fiona Apple and Caribou somehow made the best music of their careers, late into their careers, topping even the astonishing high points of The Idler Wheel... and Our Love (or Up In Flames, take your pick). Same with Yves Tumor and Fontaines D.C., who have now entered the ranks of essential artists.
I've casually enjoyed Paramore in the past, but I had no idea Hayley Williams could make something as weird and rewarding as Petals for Armor.
Nap Eyes were the one previously unheard by me artist that caught my attention this year, when the impossible to ignore "Mark Zuckerberg" came up on some shuffled playlist. This band is totally in my sweet spot of catchy tunes paired with clever lyrics that exist somewhere along the spectrum of They Might Be Giants to Courtney Barnett.
Meanwhile, RTJ delivered exactly what we rely on them for which felt especially vital this year. Haim released their Modern Vampires of the City. Grimes made her most Grimes album ever.

Easily one of my faves from the album!

One of my favorite features of some songs is when the artist hits on some undeniable melody/soundscape and just lets it go and go and go.

Oh yes same here! It's a huge part of why I love atmospheric black metal so much. Why end this song here when we can ride this amazing sound out for another 5-10 minutes?

While MADLO overall disappointed me as well (although I don't mind experimentation/expansion of a band's sound), it did yield one of my favorite tracks this year in 'There Must Be Mre Than Blood'.

I see Making The Door Less Open as more of a transitional work from his material till now, which helped me process my feelings towards it. Its not a bad album in any way, its just very all over the place. So this album's legacy in my head is very much dependent on what they release next.

I'm pumped for you on the Pink Floyd front. They get lumped into the "cheesy stoner bands you can only like in High School" category, but Dark Side of the Moon, Animals, Wish You Were Here, and Meddle are 4 of the best front-to-back Albums of all time. FWIW I think Dark Side is the greatest album ever made, and not in a "that's just my opinion, man," way - the combination of avant-garde noise with rock with melody with production is still mind-blowing decades later. Beyond the technical stuff, "Us vs. Them," "Money," "Time," Great Gig in the Sky," etc. are truly gorgeous, transcendent songs.

You are correct (followed closely by Meddle)

Probably their most underrated but I think if most people heard DSOTM without the cultural baggage it would still be their consensus #1. On the other hand, I'm glad the culture caught up with The Wall being mostly garbage, because when I was in HS that was the most popular choice.

12/1/20 12:40 PM+3REPLY

raptor jesus
I agree with you on the objective best album ever for DSOTM (though I am still 100% in the Meddle is my favorite fandom). Combined with the fact that despite its strangeness, it's one of the best selling records of all time. Then as far as iconic album covers go... a truly incredible album. It's also why I love Meddle so much. The band that made DSOTM didn't do it out of nowhere. They were already churning at full speed. It's why the following run of albums are also great. Gotta love an album so great that all the band's albums released around it are all considered classics as well.

12/1/20 12:56 PM+5REPLY

panakabear (in reply to raptor jesus)
And people often forget that Obscured By Clouds was between Meddle and DSOM. To me it's even better than Meddle. In many of the songs on it you can hear the evolution toward the melodies in Dark Side.

I upvoted you regarding DSOTM before I finished reading your comment and now I wish I could take it back for the part about The Wall, that's a great album (especially if you love Bob Ezrin productions, which man oh man, I do)

12/1/20 7:40 PM+1REPLY

HartfordTheWhale (in reply to crowleywaltz)
I feel good about stealing your upvote. I was being a bit hyperbolic because The Wall was such a big deal for a certain type of teen boy when I was growing up (including me) but I do think it sits below Piper and well below Meddle, DSOTM, Animals and WYWH in overall quality and consistency. It's got some real bangers ("Young Lust" and "Hey You" fucking rule) but way too much filler and that weird 70s rock-opera thing that just drags it down. A single disc version probably would've kicked ass though.

12/1/20 8:01 PM+1REPLY

StarkyLoveMD
I think Piper is their most underrated. In that, 90% of Pink Floyd fans don't even know it exists. I'll ride for some Syd though. It's super-influential in a way the rest of their Waters/Gilmore stuff isn't (that is, in a different way, not more). No Of Montreal without Piper at the Gates of Dawn, imo.

I’m hoping The Ascension finally clicks with me the way Age of Adz did, where I see Sufjan perform those songs six years later among his next more acoustic album and think, “Whoa, these are actually pretty good.”

I like Ascension more than The Age of Adz, and honestly, i expected better from the TAoA fandom. The folkjan fandom wants us to not like Ascension, and that is all the more reason to stan this magnificent bop for the ages.

Hot take- in an alternate reality where fetch the bolt cutters was released in a pandemic-free environment.. would people be as hot for it as critics seem to be for it this year? I love fiona and I definitely tried to get into it but it never really landed the way her other albums did.

I appreciate it, maybe I'll come back and love it with time but it's not in my top 20 of 2020.

12/1/20 12:41 PM+3REPLY

Yeah I was in the "appreciate more than like" camp for sure. Idler Wheel was the one I really gravitated toward when I dove in to the discog.

Sir Blackdove24, XXIV: I Can't Get No THEEsatisfacSSION
Yeah, I love how Fiona has been delving into progressively more daring territory with her releases, and there's a good spate of genuinely electrifying moments on Bolt Cutters, but now that I've had more time to sit with it, I'm not convinced it's a better album than Idler Wheel, which I think is her pinnacle.

As for how it would have been received had this year not been full of pandemic, she's so clearly brilliant and singular--and albums from her are so few and far between--that I think it would have still topped the year end lists. Not sure if it would have received a 10.0 from The Other Site? But I think just about everything else would still apply.

the way i have consumed music in 2020 has been weird and fitful and my lack of a commute has left me less time to like, sit and listen to an album from front to back, even though i have more free time than ever. i spend a lot of time putting music on repeat in the background and letting it seep into me slowly while i sleep or play final fantasy or do other things, and so i don’t really have a “top ten” (i’ve never really been a “top ten” person) and there are lots of things i still want to get around to but haven’t or need to explore more because i spend a week listening to nothing but that snail mail record on repeat for 16 hours a day or whatever. so instead here are some brief thoughts on some records from this year.

Jeff Rosenstock - No Dream
i guess this is probably what i would call my AOTY, though i think it’s still my third favorite Jeff record behind Worry. and POST-. we all know what Jeff does and what Jeff does makes him a singular songwriter and we’re all better off having him in our lives. no one else quite captures our current world in all it’s shitty ragged glory, and this is more of that, and that’s awesome. feel like one of these days he’s gonna really go wild on some synths for a whole record and that’s gonna be a glorious day.

Knot - Knot
of course. knot is a different band than krill and krill wrote songs about being a fucked up and miserable twenty-something and that’s still where i am in my life so this record didn’t quite ascend to the level of earth shattering importance that their older material did - which is fine. this is still a fantastic and under appreciated record about how to be a happy, responsible, and ethical person under late capitalism and also it has insane riffs. i think in a lot of ways this is the smartest and most empathetic record i listened to this year and this is a record i will return to and find new meaning in for years to come.

Nicolas Jaar - 2020
nico didn’t put out a single record i liked as much as Sirens this year, but the cumulative effect of the avalanche of new music he unleashed made something exceptionally clear to me: nicolas jaar is in my estimation the most vital artist we have (except for maybe Frank Ocean) and i will follow him anywhere he wants to go. industrial house, experimental psychedelic pop, 15 minute tone poems, live tracks from 6 years ago, whatever it is, man, i’m in.

Western State Hurricanes - Through With Love
this got absolutely no attention anywhere. as a big fan of the seemingly forgotten but fiercely beloved (by me at least) 2000s indie project The Long Winters, it’s a miracle that this album of what were thought to be unsalvageable recordings from john roderick’s pre-TLW band exists at all. i’m not sure if this is a “for fans only” release or not: if you’re familiar with the Long Winters catalogue, it’s fascinating to hear those songs with completely different arrangements. if you’re unfamiliar, it might be interesting as an artifact of the late 90’s seattle indie scene right before it blew up; these guys were playing these songs when co-headlining with pre-fame Death Cab. if there is an alternate universe where the Western State Hurricanes were the next big buzz band, this is a peak into it.

okay i don’t want to take up too much more space so here are 5 more under-discussed albums (plus one EP) from this year that are worth your time:

Owen Pallett - Island
Father John Misty - Off Key In Hamburg
Ty Dolla $ign - Featuring Ty Dolla $ign
Kali Uchis - To Feel Alive / Sin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios) ∞
070 Shake - Modus Vivendi

and here are 5 albums that everybody else liked that i ALSO liked and listened to a lot

Sufjan Stevens - The Ascension
Fleet Foxes - Shore
Gorillaz - Song Machine Volume 1
Grimes - Miss Anthropocene
The Weeknd - After Hours

12/1/20 10:13 AM+19REPLY

Kali Uchis's Isolation was one of the best albums of 2018, and a top 50 album of the whole 2010s. It's that good.

12/1/20 1:49 PM+5REPLY

thiscity
Isolation is still my favorite Kali release but i'm really enjoying her new LP and shocked basically no one is talking about it here. when i heard it was gonna be in spanish and who she was collabing with i thought it might be a bit of a sellout move (which i don't really have a problem with since latin music is bigger than ever right now) but it's just as bold in it's genre-hopping as Isolation was and the songwriting is really strong even though i can't understand most of the words. plus i love the way she peppers a line or two in english during impactful moment of almost every song so you still have something to latch onto and sing along across repeat listens. very smart and fun record that i hope people give more of a shot

12/1/20 4:53 PM+3REPLY

Sir Blackdove24, XXIV: I Can't Get No THEEsatisfacSSION
Yeah, Sin Miedo kind of felt like it came out of nowhere, but that is a shame it hasn't gotten its fair share of discussion. I kind of hate the thing where artists who are multilingual/not native English speakers feel like they have to release something in English for it to get any traction in the US, UK, et al, so that's cool that Kali is just doing her thing.
I've only given the album two or so listens, and like it so far--I was a bit surprised too at how diverse it is in its sound since I wasn't necessarily expecting that from what I could recall of the singles. But yeah, unfortunately for me I haven't had enough of a chance to digest it yet to tell if I would put it on my year end list.

'Off Key In Hamburg' was slated to be the best live album I listened to this year until 'LIVE DRUGS' came out. Owen Pallett's new album was also a sleeper hit with a LOT of replayability.

12/1/20 1:06 PM+3REPLY

thiscity
i'm still sort of coming to grips with Island honestly, like every Owen Pallett record it's so dense, and this one in particular is so much more downbeat and melancholy than the last two. that said every time i revisit it i find more to love and "A Bloody Morning" is instantly one of his most iconic tracks IMO.

A lot of the albums higher upon this list are heavily weighted towards the latter half of the year. It kinda feels like 'Have We Met''s January release was forgotten about with so much chaos and so much music since. It's easily one of the best albums of the year, if not Dan's whole career.

12/1/20 1:08 PM+3REPLY

inthedeadofknight
I'm all for Destroyer hyperbole, but his whole career? Hard to say that about a man who has Kaputt, Rubies, and Streethawk under his belt. If it was any other artist it would be a crowning achievement no doubt. He's too good.

12/2/20 8:50 AM+1REPLY

Xander Alex H
I'll give you Kaputt, I had a whole conversation on it's place in the Destroyer lineup with my younger brother last night and he talked me out of my 'Have We Met' superiority with some selected tracks. My top 3 has to be Kaputt, Rubies, and finally Have We Met. He really is too good, and I find it incredible that he made an album as sonically interesting and darkly comic at his kitchen table that somehow anticipated the year that would follow it's release.

Dogleg, Young Jesus, I’m Glad It’s You, Empress Of, Sufjan and Bob Mould are the most glaring albums missing. I’d probably put Punisher top 3.

We would be foolish to think there would be a 2020 album that would get more playtime in the beans household than LIVE DRUGS.

12/1/20 10:27 AM+10REPLY

We kinda belabored it in the SUD a couple weeks ago, but wod really snapped when they put this thing together. Plays like a well-earned (but not even comprehensive!) greatest hits where some of the live versions are actual best-version-yet improvements! Astounding!

Albums I feel particularly bad leaving off, some albums i love that just missed the cut:

Ben Seretan - Youth Pastoral
Touche Amore - Lament
Disq - Collector
Gum Country - Somewhere
SPICE - SPICE

Stray thoughts:

Trace Mountains was the runaway winner of the "Record I throw on when I just can't choose what to listen to" award.

I had the strongest *emotional* response to I'm Glad It's You, The Ascension (title track), and SAULT. As far as I'm Glad It's You, I mean, straight up blubbering at the pain and release of these songs. I'll leave that at that.

(I also got emotional at multiple points during LIVE DRUGS lmao)

NOACF isn't perfect but the middle third on its own is basically a full album in itself and is so fucking awesome, to say nothing of the great tracks outside that run.

Artists I had been previously pretty agnostic on that I loved this year: Waxahatchee, Fleet Foxes, Young Jesus

HAIM is comeback artist of the year. They killed it.

12/1/20 11:32 AM+8REPLY

Notgreatbob
Women in Music Part III is really stellar. The more I listen to it the more it creeps up my rankings.

I think Robin Pecknold was the only artist I trashed on the Stereogum boards this year and then he releases an album that blows me away.

I wish NOACF didn’t take so dang long to get going, because that middle section* is just in-fucking-credible and is really an entire albums worth of tunes on its own.

I think that LIVE DRUGS album is incredible. That cut of "Strangest Thing" is amazing.

12/1/20 11:11 AM+6REPLY

WaterRat
Strangest Thing is prob my favorite Drugs song...and I do like the cut on this live album.

BUT

It drives me nuts after the first solo when they mellow back out for the "Be the writer of your own story" section before blasting back off for the second guitar solo. IDK, it just bums me out.

With that said, I'm being pedantic. LIVE DRUGS rules and I'm going to be listening to it forever.

I honestly needed to post a top 50 because I didn't have room for IGIY, RBCF or Young Jesus but I loved those albums too

Trace Mountains is one that I put on once and forgot about, but then it would keep coming up on shuffle when I would go on my daily walks with my 1 year old daughter and it just slowly wriggled its way into my brain. Some of my best memories from this year are those still-sunny fall walks. Fallin' Rain is a sublime ear worm and possibly my SOTY

Another live album that could be a Career Achievement Award is Nick Cave's Idiot Prayer - still too new, but I suspect that will be an essential one-stop-shop for his discography.

You know that when even I agree on the pop album of the year, someone goofed that ordering.

12/1/20 10:35 AM+4REPLY

Hot take: pop music kinda sucked this year and Future Nostalgia is fine.

I’ll take the Carly b-sides over any other major label pop release from this year

12/1/20 10:48 AM+3REPLY

fkacody
I would say pop music killed it this year but i would also put Jessie, Roisin, and Charli in that category and also i loved Chromatica lol. But if you're asking about Halsey, Selena, Miley...yeah you right.

12/1/20 11:05 AM+5REPLY

padfoot24 (in reply to fkacody)
Mostly talking about the big names. Nothing was aggressively bad (except Bieber maybe) but it was just all so bland to me.

If listmas 2020 has taught me one thing this year is that I am not as *here* for the disco revival as I thought I would be. Jessie Ware made my favorite disco/pop album of this year, though and it’s not even close.

12/1/20 11:30 AM+1REPLY

bakedbeans (in reply to padfoot24)
Doh! completely forgot to even add Jessie Ware to my list/tracker. woopsie

Basically the only big-name pop things i really cared about this year were "Blinding Lights" and "Rain On Me" cause those two songs are undeniable.

12/1/20 11:47 AM+5REPLY

padfoot24 (in reply to bakedbeans)
I guess I’m lying because Charli is in my top 20. But I don’t put her in with the Dua Lipa/Lady Gaga/Ariana crowd in my head, cause if she were than “Gone” would have charted wayyy higher.

12/1/20 1:22 PM+4REPLY

fkacody (in reply to padfoot24)
I wouldn't put her in that group either, i've always seen Charli as more of an indie pop artist even if she is signed to a major label mostly bc her label doesnt know what in the fuck to do with her

12/1/20 2:26 PM+3REPLY

fkacody (in reply to bakedbeans)
so...you didn't listen to Jessie?

12/1/20 1:18 PM+3REPLY

bakedbeans (in reply to fkacody)
No, I did listen, and I liked/loved it, it just came out in a portion of the year when I was spending WAY less time in front of my computer (on purpose, after remote learning in spring) so I just completely whiffed on making it into my regularly updated log.

"Soul Control" *always* gets the entire family MOVING

Every year the Stereogum's list is pretty solid. Mine is a bit different nonetheless.

And I keep the metal ones for the Black Market, but Spectral Lore & Mare Cognitum, Neptunian Maximalism, Oranssi Pazuzu, Paysage d'Hiver and many more saved my year.

Other REALLY good albums that I liked this year but either forgot when rushing to submit my official #list or didn't quite make the cut but are still worthy:

Yves Tumor
The Strokes
Gillian Welch's massive output
Charley Crockett
Shamir
Andy Shauf
The Killers
The Beths
Christian Lee Hutson

Albums I didn't like as much as everyone else apparently:

Haim (not bad...merely pleasant to my ears)
Jason Isbell (one of my favorite musicians, but this album felt like a retread/step back)
Soccer Mommy (Circle the Drain is one of my favorite songs of the year, but the rest of the album didn't love up to that song's promise IMO).

Same, I think there's a lot of good stuff happening there even if the songwriting isn't consistently aces. Still "Circle the Drain" - legendary song.

12/1/20 11:47 AM+3REPLY

padfoot24 (in reply to dansolo)
I think the songwriting IS consistently aces, but it’s not as punchy as what we’re used to. More languid, spindly, but tight band grooves, fewer bedroom pop bangers, and the lyrics follow suit. Typical grower kind of stuff, and it’s been a godsend during early onset SAD season.

12/1/20 1:26 PM+4REPLY

Xander Alex H (in reply to dansolo)
'Circle the Drain' would've topped the Billboard 100 chart if it came out between 1998-2001. Amazing distillation of the 90's indie rock vibe.

12/1/20 12:48 PM+3REPLY

billypilgrim
Yep. I liked Dreamsicle and some of the other songs are good and I'm sure will sound phenomenal live, but overall it just didn't feel like he was really pushing himself, and there was some writing that almost felt cliche, when usually he is so far on the other end of the spectrum there.

12/1/20 4:44 PM+1REPLY

jimsouls
Really nice list. I saw Hutson open for Julia Jacklin in 2019. It's nice to see his album getting some attention. A master of subtlety. His songs relate to universal feelings, and he doesn't beat you over the head with his sense of humor. I also like that his songs don't overstay their welcome. Just an impressive record.

The Gillian Welch stuff is a godsend. My wife and I were wondering if we'd ever get another album from here, then wound up getting three in the space of a few months. Granted, Rawlings' albums should count as part of their output. His "Airplane" was one of my favorite songs of 2017. A Welch/Rawlings show from 2004 is among my favorite 10 ever. Always great seeing those two. An otherworldly experience.

And just to pile on, my 2020 musically is probably actually defined by my deep dive into Talking Heads' full discography, and a couple of playlists I made (one focusing on Power Pop from the early 70's on, one on 90's and early 00's mainstream country, and one called Stay at Home that was just a smorgasbord with a ton of 80's British music on it, particularly XTC).

Also a lot of comfort food type stuff like Ben Folds Five, The New Pornographers, REM and The Shins.

1. Xibalba

3. Ulcerate
4. Afterbirth
5. Ulthar
6. The Ocean
7. Molassess
8. Atramentus
9. Bedsore

18. The Acacia Strain - Slow Decay
19. Defeated Sanity
20. Spirit Adrift

Besides Xibalba, the undoubted AOTY, this list could be in any other order, such was the vast amount of extreme high quality. There are also minimum 20 other records that could have climbed into this list had I had the time. I’ll save all my fawning for the Metal list since this is just 20 metal records but my non-Metal albums of the year are Phoebe and Soft Kill.

MSW and Atramentus should be on my list too, actually. Too many great albums.

mjhk75
And Eternal Champion should be on mine!

12/1/20 10:56 AM+4REPLY

Reverend Weird
All three of those records could be #1's in any other year. MSW is the record I've most fervently looking forward to finding a distro in the UK, I should have a copy by 2021! Atramentus provided the best "full package" of the year, the map and short story the accompany the album flesh the experience out into something worth fully investing your time into. I'm usually always working or playing videogames or idly scrolling the 'Gum whilst I'm listening to music but Atramentus had me set aside everything to immerse myself in what really boils down to an especially Lovecraftian DND campaign. Meanwhile, Eternal Champ proved they are the Eternal Champs by outriffing EVERYONE, including themselves.

The Bell Witch/Stygian Bough collab was magic, too.

Heavy as fuck. Metal had such a good year that there isn't a ton of overlap between our lists, but I'm still nodding in agreement. MSW and Atramentus were painful omissions.

And Phoebe is clearly the most metal in the indiesphere.

I think I'm most surprised by how much I like the new Killers album, I've been listening to it pretty regularly since August. Similar for HAIM, both are just fun listens full of jams.

Don't think its gotten a love of PR (no p4k review for example), so probably just not on people's radars. I wouldn't have heard it at all probably if I hadn't randomly heard If I Told on Hype Machine, which just blew me away.

Now that it got a Grammy nom maybe hopefully it'll get a little more love.

12/1/20 12:32 PM+1REPLY

Yesterday I was sort of reviewing my own 2020 playlist, thinking about my annual top 25 list, and I couldn't believe how much music from the beginning of the year seemed to be from a lifetime ago. That U.S. Girls album? Francis Quinlan? Grimes finally putting out a new one, and it was a dud? Did these things really happen?

12/1/20 10:27 AM+5REPLY

carson
I want to like that Frances Quinlan album so much, especially because Bark Your Head Off, Dog is an actual masterpiece. But Likewise is what Hop Along would sound like if the songs never ever really came together. There are pieces there, but I wish the songs would build to those big moments.

12/1/20 3:13 PM0REPLY

Spudlord
I saw two shows in 2020 and I feel fortunate in that regard, sadly. If my last memory of live music is Torche dropping hammers on my skull with meat then I suppose I can't complain. The hammers were not meat-laden, for clarity's sake. The other was Blood Invantation which involved dropping acid filled weather balloons on my brain.

Here are some tasty spuds:
1. Mare Cognitun & Spectral Lore - Wanderers: Astrology Of the Nine
2. Thou & Emma Ruth Rundle - May Our Chambers Be Full
3. Black Curse - Endless Wound
4. Nap Eyes - Snapshot Of a Beginner
5. Porridge Radio - Every Bad
6. Pantha du Prince - Conference Of Trees
7. Fluisteraars - Bloem
8. Eternal Champion - Ravening Iron
9. Couch Slut - Take A Chance On Rock N' Roll
10. Woods - Strange To Explain
11. Moodyman - Taken Away
12. Sweven - The Eternal Resonance
13. Wake - Devouring Ruin
14. REZN - Chaotic Divine
15. Spirit Adrift - Enlightened In Eternity
16. My Morning Jacket - The Waterfall II
17. Jason Isbell & The 400 Unit - Reunions
18. Midwife - Forever
19. Bedsore - Hypnagogic Hallucinations
20. Hum - Inlet

SOTY: "Rune's Heart" - Panopticon. One of the most heart-wrenching, touching black metal songs you'll ever hear.

Here's to a better 2021!

I rewatched the live stream they did back in the Spring and it's still the best stream I saw this year. The image of them blackened out against a harsh white background bobbing along to "Ilmestys" is etched into my brain.

Hell yeah, I saw the Forest Hills summer show and am glad I got that in, as badly as I wanted to go to one of the Red Rocks ones.

And while they are my favorite band of my adult life, I like to think I don't gush over everything they do automatically - I thought Evil urges and Circuital were both uneven and flawed, but both Waterfalls have just been so so so good.

12/1/20 1:06 PM+2REPLY

Hell yes to "Rune's Heart"; one of my favorite musci memories of the year was when I was making the move to the west coast, and driving through the Canadian rockies blasting it. Sound and scenery melted into an indiscernible, sublime mass, and it made me want to do and be more.

This is how I feel about the Microphones album. I've listened to it twice and it's in my top 20 because it's that good (and that "unreplayable").

12/1/20 2:08 PM+4REPLY

Analogbrat
This had been a theme with me and Fiona before - love the albums but rarely play them. Then I revisited her three previous albums to prepare to fetch the bolt cutters and wondered why I stopped revisiting them. I haven't listened to Bolt Cutters the most out of all the music this year, but it's certainly gotten some replay.

12/1/20 6:28 PM+1REPLY

sure. however - if this is where your going - i think bolt cutters is a staggering acheivement, but it’s replayability def factors into how i judge an album. it’s not in my top 10.

12/1/20 2:45 PM+5REPLY

Why not? I've only ever seen "Werckmeister Harmonies" once, for example, and it remains my favorite film ever. Some works of art leave an impression that extends far beyond their own finite temporal constitutions.

12/1/20 2:46 PM+4REPLY

jackunderscore
for me this is where the film / music analogy starts to break down. at the end of the day, music I love is music I listen to frequently.

12/1/20 3:50 PM+5REPLY

antigone (in reply to jackunderscore)
Very fair! It's mostly the same for me, tho there are a handful of albums that are incredibly dear to my heart that I'll maybe listen to once or twice a year and find that more than enough; "The Seer" & "Soundtracks for the Blind", (Branca's) "The Ascension", "You Won't Get What You Want" etc.

12/1/20 6:41 PM+4REPLY

dansolo
Just to buck the consensus in this thread (which probably isn't the overall consensus given how many people included Fiona on their lists): I love listening to Fetch the Bolt Cutters, and I get that it isn't an "easy" listen but I think its very enjoyable nonetheless. If I still drove a car like I did when Idler Wheel came out I would probably drive around singing along to it just like I did with that album (like how fun is it to howl along to "Drumset" or "Heavy Balloon"? very fun, for me, anyway). There's a lot of wit to the lyrics and arrangements. And it is my favorite kind of album in that it never sticks in one gear too long before it shapeshifts to the next thing. Heavy, yes, a slog, no way.

12/1/20 5:52 PM+7REPLY

There's dogs and dolphin noises all over this thing. It's *mostly* a fun album.

Jessie Ware and Woods would also be very high on the list. Yumi Zouma, Cable Ties, Sault (x2), Nada Surf, Perfume Genius, The Heliocentrics, Pantha du Prince, Yves Tumor, and Frances Quinlan might round out some of an unordered list...

Looking at these lists and I realized I probably listened to jazz at a 70% clip compared to other genres this year. Working on a top 20 jazz alhums and top 20 jazz songs of 2020, but I'll probably post that on the December jazz column.

So much stuff - Idris Ackamoor & the Pyramids, the Sun Ra Arkestra, Shabaka and the Ancestors, Irreversible Entanglements, Ambrose Akinmusire, Nubya Garcia - that was great, but I think a special mention should go to Just Coolin', the rediscovered Art Blakey recording. Not only is it some straight up bop fire with The Messengers tearing it up, but actually hearing new music FROM the golden age, rather than music inspired by it, is just so damn thrilling.

Fleet Foxes - Shore
Phoebe Bridgers - Punisher
RBCF - Sideways to New Italy

Freddie Gibbs & The Alchemist - Alfredo

RTJ - RTJ4

Trace Mountains - Lost in the Country
The Killers - Imploding the Mirage
Charli XCX - how im feeling now
Aaron Parks - Little Big II: Dreams of a Mechanical Man
Ella Minus - acts of rebellion

I don't have anything like the patience required to craft and fine tune a list, so instead I'd like to chuck some stuff out there that doesn't appear here that I really enjoyed. In general the 'Gum is pretty good at keeping up with the music scene here across the point - UK jazz, grime, metal and hardcore all get excellent coverage - but you have an odd blind spot, shared by the other site, for UK psych/noise madness, a scene flourishing as surely as any other. Many of my favourite records of the year sprouted out of this fetid swamp of gnarly riffs; Luminous Bodies' Nah Nah Nah Yeah Yeah, Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs' Viscerals, We Wild Blood's Vicious Virtues (probably my overall favourite of the year, if you forced me to make a decision) and the mighty Hey Colossus' Dances/Curses are all wonderful albums, and I thoroughly recommend them to anyone who wants to headbang this shithole of a year out of sight and out of mind.

And now a big ol' list of some other stuff I really liked, for the sake of it; Pa Salieu (been on repeat since it dropped last week), Uada, Chubby & The Gang, Irreversible Entanglements, Ulcerate, Shirley Collins, Incantation, Wake, Inexorum, Nubya Garcia, Sault, Villaelvin, Esoctrilihum, Nazar, Westerman, Bambara, Henn Ogled, Raul Monsalve, Pyrrhon, R.A.P. Ferreira, Nap Eyes, Dogleg, Nate Wooley, Motorpsycho, The Koreatown Oddity, Destroyer, Elvis Costello. There'll be loads more, obviously - I think I actively sought out more music than ever, thanks to the state we all currently find ourselves in, and I'll never get round the giving everything that deserves it the love I want to.

I would also like to shout out Bright Eyes, Hamilton Leithauser, the Killers, My Morning Jacket (really disappointed not to see this in Gum's top 50 -- c'mon guys!), and Tame Impala for releasing albums that got me through this year.

Weird year for music! Felt like a lot of great albums but few clear front runners (other than Fetch The Bolt Cutters, which is an amazing album, but which IMO definitely benefited from its release timing).

One of my favorite albums that didn’t make this list is Oceanator (although to be fair, I only discovered them through the new band list a few weeks ago, so credit to the Gum where it’s due). Goddamn, “I Would Find You” might be my song of the year. Charli asked for anthems to soundtrack the apocalypse, and Oceanator delivered: “If the world fell apart tomorrow / I would find you / I would come for you.” While it’s a broad song—it could be about romantic love, friendship, family, or even solidarity—it also perfectly captures that March 2020 feeling of being stuck inside your apartment all day, only going out once at 10 PM for a walk after the streets have cleared out. Sonically, it’s kind of like wholesome Joy Division (although the rest of the album is more 90s rock revival).

And if all that doesn’t convince you, Oceanator also has a split covers EP with Bartees Strange called “Tear The Fascists Down” (!!).

I also just want to say thanks to everyone here. Scott for keeping the lights on. The regular writers for keeping that sweet, sweet, distracting content flowing. The other guest writers for going long on cool shit I’ve either never heard before (Soul Glo y’all), or can’t stop listening to already and am desperately consuming every word on the internet about. The commenters for being fun to argue with about trivial things like new music during a global pandemic. My wife for never reading what I post here.

And a little blurbage now that I've claimed my space:

Like a lot of people, I listened to music differently this year. Sometimes I listened to a lot more, just needing to fill time and silence, but in a way that could feel compulsive or joyless. Sometimes music lost its flavor for weeks at a time and I just listened to podcasts instead. But the music that broke through the funk and connected with me was the music that engaged and reflected my restlessness and anxiety rather than trying too soothe it. Even "Saint Cloud," the closest think to a soothing record here, plays to me like the sound of hard-won contentment and even the way it renders the bliss of partnership is cut with anxiety ("Can't Do Much"). Fiona Apple's instant classic of an album makes that itching for liberation central from the title track on down, and it plays self-sufficiency less like an ideology than a defensive adaptation, learning to make music from the sound of driving yourself up the walls. Moses Sumney's Grae takes on the idea of being "islanded" (isolated) in a similarly sprawling manner, its kaleidoscope of moods and sounds reflecting the moment where your inner monologue is so scattered and loud that its starts to become a weird kind of dialogue. Fitting for an album that dwelled on "multiplicity," it has three of the best songs of the year - Cut Me, Virile, and especially the devastating Me in 20 Years - that sound nothing like each other.

That's also what kept me coming back to my favorite album of the year, Set My Heart on Fire Immediately. Despite spending most of every single day, week, month in the same 1100 sq ft apartment, this was an album that helped me to find universes of imagination and feeling, which helped me keep passion and creativity in my life, and which also was just the most compulsively replayable, alluring, and rewarding batch of songs I heard all year. Mike has made a few records I've loved now, but none that set my heart on fire quite like this one.

Beautifully written. I know we went back and forth about the Perfume Genius album before, but let me just say this: Despite not really loving the album like that, what made me warm up to it considerably is realizing just how weird it is ("Moonbend" did the trick). A lot of the coverage around it focussed on how Mike was at a much better place mentally and willing to take on all kinds of (musical) challenges, and in the wake of that it is easy to overlook that these songs are often times incredibly lonely, sad and twisted (also heartfelt and beautiful). And in a way I appreciate that. The album's not my favorite in his discography, but it is a grower and who knows where it might end up?

Also "I know you called me and I didn't pick up, I was busy freaking out" is already an instant classic line/musical moment from Mike.

I feel like I've been more distracted than usual this year, still a bunch of albums I'd like to spend more time with, and I'm looking forward to finding the stuff I've overlooked completely this year.

I like the stuff Phoebe Bridgers has done before this year but maybe didn't love it, although I do love the title Stranger in the Alps. So I was optimistic about Punisher, but it completely blew me away and was exactly the album I needed this year.

12/1/20 10:52 AM+8REPLY

padfoot24
Same re: Phoebe. I’ve been a fan of her non-boygenius stuff from a distance, but Punisher was just the perfect blend of self-lacerating wit, gentle psychadelia, and sincere absurdity that kept me feeling positive when 2020 was trying it’s best to keep me focused on hopelessness.

I think Punisher is better than Stranger In the Alps, but I think her best song is "Smoke Signals". But maybe I'm just a sucker for a Lemmy Kilmister namedrop. Jesus, Phoebe's kvlt as hell.

Can’t really argue with much here - RTJ, Fiona and Phoebe were early winners for me but Bob Mould, Deftones and Sylvan Esso were my favourites that didn’t make the top 50 that came out later in the year.

Also, for anyone who was disappointed by the last Slearer Kinney album, don’t sleep on the Cable Ties record - definitely scratches that itch. What a great year for music in a bad year for living.

One light in a shit year was Bandcamp Friday. I was lucky enough to work from home this year, and being unable to go to bars meant lots of extra money that I could spend on stuff like Light In The Attic reissues, The Storehouse Bandcamp Comp, and albums from smaller artists who could definitely use it and who were often introduced to me by this site (shout out to Little Kid). It was also a good year to get really into artists (Neil Young, Joni Mitchell) and genres (American Primitive) that I knew I liked but hadn’t fully plumbed the depths of their discographies. I now have strong Jaco Pastorius and also Kottke opinions! I want you all to have better years than this one, and I want Big Thief to reschedule their show at The National.

This year I didn’t try to think of music within a list-context, I just collected releases that I liked and ended up with 43 albums. Organizing them into a list feels kinda wrong, or at least significantly harder than it used to be for the past few years. I think I like it that way, keeps me on my toes. Lists are fun but they somewhat simplify all the kinds of emotions one can have towards music.

ANYWAY since I still want to revel in music discussion with y’all, here are six album that I’m super sure of:

1. Nicolas Jaar - Telas
Constantly building and falling apart, this album created such a wonderful space for me. Hints of Jazz and electronic music are faintly present, but everything that happens in this hour feels new and inspiring and fresh. What a record.

2. Arca - kick i
So fierce, precise, rough, catchy.

3. Moses Sumney - græ
The song cycle that kept on giving. Beautifully woven, intricate instrumentation, vocals to die for (also: packaging oty).

4. Kate NV - Room For the Moon
Unfolding with a childlike warmth and joy, yet undoubtedly melancholic, yet not nostalgic. Atmospheric, too. Opens up a strange room that is not quite past and not quite present, and lets the moon in.

5. Four Tet - Sixteen Oceans
This album sounds like a blast of sunshine and warm air.

6. Wren Dove Lark – ODDBIRD
I'm biased, I'll admit that. But these songs haven't left my mind this year, and nor have the strange creatures and weird colors they conjure up. Future druid AOTY.

Here are 14 more that stayed with me, but that I can’t rank for now:

Charli XCX – how I’m feeling now
Jónsi – Shiver
The Microphones – Microphones in 2020
Rina Sawayama – Sawayama
Adrianne Lenker – songs
Autechre – PLUS/SIGN
Annie – Dark Hearts
Eartheater – Phoenix: Flames Are Dew Upon My Skin
Meitei – Kofu
Open Mike Eagle – Anime, Trauma & Divorce
Yves Tumor – Heaven to a Tortured Mind
Haru Nemuri – Lovetheism
Oranssi Pazuzu– Mestarin Kynsi
Holly Childs & Gediminas Žygus – Hydrangea

Favorite EP:
Christine & the Queens – La Vita Nuova (and it’s not even close).

Happy listmas everybody. I was not ready to do this at all. I will look at your lists now.

Couldn’t have made it through this year without your support sleepy. It was such a fun journey working with you. 💖🥰

I haven’t even thought about my list yet. It’ll probably be early 2021 in classic me fashion before I have one ready. It’ll definitely have folklore, punisher, fetch the bolt cutters, untitled (rise), peaceful as hell, mydata, (obv I’m biased here) pain mop girl 2020, and fires in heaven on it.

I think my bigger priority is I’m going to spend some energy in December collecting my favorite albums/songs of 2020 from artists who would never be included in a list like this and making a twitter thread talking about it. So if peeps are interested, stay tuned on Twitter haha

I feel like I was disappointed by a lot of the new records by favorites that I was looking forward to (Jason Isbell, Margo Price both come to mind, not that either were bad records but they weren't what I wanted from either of them) and obviously it was a somewhat quiet year overall in terms of new stuff, I 'liked' plenty but didn't love a lot. So the stuff I loved:

Modern Nature - Annual
Colter Wall - Western Swing & Waltzes
Jackie Lynn - Jacqueline
The 1975 - Notes On A Conditional Form
Taylor Swift - Folklore
Mosses- TV Sun
Courtney Marie Andrews - Old Flowers
William Tyler - New Vanitas
Shirley Collins - Heart’s Ease
Nine Inch Nails - Ghosts V/VI
Fleet Foxes - Shore
Jennifer Castle - Monarch Season

This suffers from a huge lack of country by the way. No Becky Warren, or Jesse Daniel, or Arlo McKinley. Instead, a somewhat subpar Jason Isbell though still very good and Sam Hunt. Honestly best of lists almost always have to leave things out, but that is a big gap at least for me.

2020 was a slow year for me yikes… I spent more time digging up older music then listening to new stuff, but it was all new to me, and honestly Night Moves was all I wanted to listen to after discovering them, so…

But here’s 10 albums that are actually from 2020 that I listened to and enjoyed the most, I guess. Old faves like The Strokes, Real Estate, and Car Seat Headrest too. Caribou, Plants and Animals, STRFKR, and Pure X were also solid.

Wolf Parade - Thin Mind
Gengahr – Sanctuary

I look forward to the day that traditional/veteran rockers aren't overlooked. The Strokes and The Killers released great albums this year.

Instead we see Taylor Swift wearing her indie costume at number 5 and Stay Inside (a band that would've been an opener for Brand New/Taking Back Sunday in 2005) at 29. And I say that as a fan of both albums, but c'mon.

I really need to revisit that album! I kind of missed it when it dropped due to life stuff happening so I never really got to sit with it properly. I will say though that In Birdsong is one of the best songs of the year easily

Glad I finally had an excuse to log into my Stereogum account on the new system. I say it every year, but I really do appreciate both this site and the comment section below it in equal measures.

Holy shit ... someone else actually likes Nada Surf, perhaps most underrated power pop band?
Not their very best album ever, but they just don't miss at all, do they?
I don't have them in my Top 10, but I'd certainly place for them in the 10-20 range as well.

12/1/20 11:53 AM+3REPLY

Yeah man! They aren't blowing anyone's minds, but they are out there doing their thing, and I find that comforting enough to have given this album a ton of listens this year.

Did Grimes get deducted points for her baby-naming shenanigans or other very public foot-in-mouthisms?

I'm really surprised Miss Anthopocene wasn't listed -- a great album all around!

12/1/20 11:23 AM+4REPLY

compuff
Miss Anthro left me kinda cold. It has a solid run through the middle, but it felt like Grimes' adventurousness calcified in an uninteresting kind of way. Felt like an album that wasn't created as much as it was turned in, IMO.

12/1/20 12:58 PM0REPLY

sleepyheadphone
This is a very personal thing, but her whole obsession with dystopian cyberpunk turned me off a lot. Plus the whole Elon Musk situation kinda bled into all of that, and it ended up being a rather uncomfortable listen for me. That and I'm not the biggest nu-metal fan, so she lost points in that department as well.

I don't think it's a bad record though, my hangups with it are mostly due to personal preference.

12/1/20 1:43 PM0REPLY

Pauly Steyreen
I'm not stanning for her to be #1, but she'd be in my Top 20 for sure.

Yes, I'm kind of put off by many of her personal statements and Elon's libertarian whining (not her fault). But at the same time, I'm not one to let that influence my musical taste. I love me some old Smashing Pumpkins even if Billy Corgan is a ghoul.

Anyway, I wouldn't call it Grimes' best work (that would be Art Angels), but I'm still listening to tracks from Miss Anthropocene nearly every day, so it's definitely Top 20 material...

12/1/20 4:28 PM+3REPLY

thiscity
i really really enjoyed this record but i'm also not surprised it didn't really blow people away, and i do think that her shenanigans turned people off (some of that leaks into the lyrics, too, which i mostly try to ignore). Darkseid is an awesome NIN ripoff though and IDORU is one of my favorite songs of the year

The William Basinski album was a pretty beautiful listen. And Silver Ladders! Almost forgot about that one but it arrived at such a distinct point in the year that it already takes me back even though it's only been a few months.

Also, I haven't really checked out Aesop Rock yet, need to do that aesap

12/1/20 11:54 AM+5REPLY

antigone
I don't know how Bill keeps doing it, but some of those tracks are among the most beautiful he's ever made, which is saying something! And "Silver Ladders" is as much a balm as it is a record, and surely her best work yet; "Til A Mermaid Drags You Under" is capital T transcendent. The Aes record is really great; he's just so consistent its almost mind-bending. SWFG is probably already a Top 5 release from him for me, get on it!

12/1/20 12:08 PM+2REPLY

sleepyheadphone
Something about Silver Ladders constantly draws me back in. It has, much like the Kate NV record, such a strong moody presence. I love that about it. And yes, very soothing.

And yeah, Lamentations is somehow among his best. It's like a Eluvium/Caretaker crossover, and I just dig those tones so much.

Marigold is really really good. It got a lil bit pre-pandemic memory-holed, but the best songs on it complex and heartfelt in a way that blends the punchier Cardinal and more reflective Skylight really well.

12/1/20 12:03 PM+8REPLY

Novemberists
I liked it but there are more weaker songs on there than their other albums. The title track at the end is irrelevant and I find No Drugs or Alcohol to be cloying/annoying.

I listened to Dotted Line more than just about any other song this year though so it's still a solid album.

12/1/20 1:14 PM+1REPLY

Disappyramid
I'll give you the title track....there could've been a bit more to that one, even on the instrumental side.

But songs like The Alarmist, Moment and Endless are nicely fleshed out in comparison to some of the earlier work. Overall, their recording/production sounds stronger.

12/1/20 1:54 PM+1REPLY

Novemberists
I think the singles were the best of maybe any Pinegrove album but it doesn't hang together as a whole the way that Cardinal or Skylight do.

At first I thought the same way about Skylight but now I love songs like Patterson and Leo and Thanksgiving. No Drugs has not grown on me in the same way.

2. Boldy James - Price of Tea in China
3. Ella Minus - acts of rebellion (best discovery)
4. Infant Island - Beneath (kept climbing up as the year went on)
5. Empty Country - S/T

8. Kelly Lee Owens - Inner Song
9. Eve Owen - Don’t Let the Ink Dry (another gorgeous album that kept getting better)

HMs:
Loathe - I let it in and it took everything
Deserta - Black Aura my Sun

IDK if I'm ready to say I like Miss Anthropocene more than Art Angels quite yet, but it already feels like the essential Grimes album to me. The whole ethereal techno metal cyberpunk vibe sounds like something she's been working her way to all along, very much in keeping with her visual aesthetic and her extracurricular interests. "My Name is Dark" and "Delete Forever" and "Idoru" go straight to the Grimes Hall of Fame, probably "4AEM" too.

12/1/20 12:04 PM+5REPLY

toxotoxotoxotoxo
Delete Forever might be my SOTY idk if she’s ever made a better track (I know I know Oblivion and Genesis exist) than that. I was ready to hate Miss Anthropocene because of her constant antics but on the extreme contrary....I’d also throw in Darkseid to your list goddamn that song goes so hard.

Delete Forever - top tier SOTY, top tier Grimes song

12/1/20 1:10 PM+3REPLY

I’m with you both. It’s her most Grimes-y album and I’m very here for it. Neither of you mentioned “So Heavy I Fell Through the Earth” or “You’ll miss me when I’m not around”, which are two of my favorites.

Also think “Violence” might be the most Grimes that she has ever sounded a la “Myth” by Beach House.

Slift is a great band from a city I love dearly and I even have friends who are very good friends with them, so I guess I had more reason to listen to the record than the average music fans.

Neil Young - Homegrown (come on, peak-era NY)
Sturgill Simpson - Cuttin' Grass V1
DARKSIDE - Psychic Live July 17 2014
Tom Petty - Wildflowers & All the Rest
Makaya McCraven / Gil Scott-Heron - We're New Again: A Reimagining by Makaya McCraven (considered just including this on the main list)

I said Sylvan Esso's Free Love had a few high-end tracks ("Train", "Rooftop Dancing, and to a slightly lesser extent "Numb" and "Ferris Wheel) on it but didn't make the album list I shared; that's true of Khruangbin as well. "So We Won't Forget" is my favorite song of the year and the other two early singles are up there, too (+ "Texas Sun" w/Leon Bridges, but that track technically appeared late last year).

Gigaton is the shit. I was kind of mad at Black Thought for taking forever to release his new one so I may have held that against him.

Yves Tumor — Heaven to a Tortured Mind
Christian Lee Hutson - Beginners (perfect from top to bottom)
Andy Shauf - The Neon Skyline
Adrianne Lenker - songs
Waxahatchee - St. Cloud

Anyway i did not realize this list was coming so soon so i dont really have one ahh!! All i know for sure is:

Waxahatchee is my album of the year, with fleet foxes in a close second and thundercat in a close third

But i set a personal record for new albums listened to in a year in 2020 (something between 80 and 95 new releases) so its tough to sift through, some assorted faves in no real order were:
-tennis: swimmer
-freddie: alfredo
-caroline rose: superstar (that one turned out to be a grower)
-caribou: suddenly
-real estate: the main thing
-rap ferreira: purple moonlight pages
-future islands: as long as you are
-hamilton leithauser: the loves of your life
-khruangbin: mordechai
-boldy james: the price of tea in china
-madeline kinney: suckers lunch
-no joy: motherhood
-anjimile: giver taker
-open mike eagle: anime trauma and divorce
-bartees strange: live forever

As good a year for new music as it was bad a year for everything else!

Yeah ive been thinking the same thing! Swimmer as a whole feels like kind of a culmination of their work so far, all the way up to how epic and tense matrimony 2 gets. Ive been following this band since day 1 and even though i liked yours conditionally i have to say i wasnt too interested in where theyd go from there, but holy crap did they seize my attention back. Runner is still my favorite song of the year. Feels like they got jipped a bit

Lol i have tickets to see them this past march that are currently rescheduled to april.... well see if it hits that date either. Bummer cause i am very anxious to see how the hell they pull of runner live and no live video exists of that song lol

It feels impossible to put this list in any semblance of order, so I won’t. A banner year for music if nothing else. Also, looking up the release dates for each of these has sent me into an existential crisis. You’ll see what I mean.

Ireland and Colombia won the year. Róisín Machine, seemingly out of nowhere, may be my favorite album of the year, with A Hero’s Death close behind. My top 20, kinda:

envy - The Fallen Crimson (February)
Ka - Descendants of Cain (May)
Bad Bunny - YHQLMDLG (February)
Yaeji - WHAT WE DREW (April)
Chloe x Halle - Ungodly Hour (June)
Deeper - Auto-Pain (March)
Dua Lipa - Future Nostalgia (March)
Shabazz Palaces - The Don of Diamond Dreams (April)
Lido Pimienta - Miss Colombia (April)
Gia Margaret - Mia Gargaret (June)
Jessie Ware - What’s Your Pleasure? (June)
Silverbacks - Fad (July)
Fontaines D.C. - A Hero's Death (July)
Destroyer - Have We Met (January)
GoGo Penguin - GoGo Penguin (June)
Róisín Murphy - Róisín Machine (October)
Open Mike Eagle - Anime, Trauma and Divorce (October)
Ela Minus - acts of rebellion (October)
Ghetto Kumbé - Ghetto Kumbé (May)
MOURN - Self Worth (October)

Maybe it's just the effect of this awful year but I haven't connected with too many new releases in 2020 — worried it's a sign I'm getting old!

The order isn't so important here but here's what I liked:
1) Destroyer (most surprising omission for me!)
2) Bob Dylan (can't believe he still had a great one in him)
3) Freddie Gibbs & Alchemist
4) Autechre
5) Adrienne Lenker
6) Fontaines DC
7) Actress (electronic needs more coverage on the Gum!)
8) Tame Impala (underrated)
9) Caribou
10) SAULT

Still need to listen to Onehotrix and Thundercat. I'll probably like them a lot knowing me...

10. Westerman
9. Fiona Apple
8. Destroyer
7. Tame Impala
6. Future Islands (as I wrote in a comment above I think they are getting tragically overlooked as a result of having Spoon/Beach House levels of consistency)

Other favorites:

and finally, perhaps most importantly, 2020 SONIC WARM BLANKET RECORDS:

Four Tet
Trace Mountains
Adrienne Lenker

(Perfume Genius and Westerman played a huge role here as well, but I already put them in my "real" ranking lol)

This is what I put on whenever I needed to relieve endless amounts of anxiety that I'm sure you all experienced in one way or another as well, and in many ways this will be the music that I actually associate with 202 in my brain for the future. I would not have made it through the year without all of this incredible music to keep me swaddled

Just a gentle reminder to everyone to please support the musicians on your respective lists any way you can. Buy albums, merch, whatever. If you stream albums for convenience that's fine but remember that it does virtually nothing to support most musicians. I generally prefer unranked lists but I do want to be included in the all-important Stereogum commenter tally so I've stuck numbers in front of these. They could go in almost any order, though--it's all good.

1. Leo Takami - Felis Catus and Silence
2. Waxahatchee - Saint Cloud
3. Nap Eyes - Snapshot of a Beginner
4. Jeff Parker - Suite for Max Brown
5. Hum - Inlet
6. Mike Polizze - Long Lost Solace Find
7. Sally Anne Morgan - Thread
8. Adrienne Lenker - songs
9. John Lee Shannon - In and Of
10. H. C. McIntire - Eno Axis
11.Terry Allen - Just Like Moby Dick
12. Alabaster DePlume - To Cy and Lee, Instrumentals Vol. 1
13. Stephen Malkmus - Traditional Techniques
14. Bob Dylan - Rough and Rowdy Ways
15. Mary Lattimore - Silver Ladders
16. James Elkington - Ever-Roving Eye
17. Destroyer - Have We Met
18. Jennifer Castle - Monarch Season
19. Run the Jewels - RTJ4
20. Brigid Mae Power - Head Above the Water
21. Fiona Apple - Fetch the Bolt Cutters
22. Green-House - Six Songs for Invisible Gardens
23. Josh Kimbrough - Slither, Soar & Disappear
24. Ezra Feinberg - Recumbent Speech
25. Gwenifer Raymond - Strange Lights Over Garth Mountain

I also loved the music that Bill Callahan, Kevin Morby, William Tyler, Channelers, Gunn-Truscinski Duo, Jeff Tweedy, Sarah Louise, Nathan Salsburg, Makaya McCraven, and WOODS, among others, put out in the world this year.

For me, 2018 and 2019 were fairly weak for music (with some obvious exceptions). I usually make a list of the best 25 albums of the year, and it was a struggle for me to fill it out those years without reaching. 2020 was exceptional though. Could easily make a top 50 that I feel good about.

I couldn't bring myself to exclude any one of these albums from this comment, so here's my Top 11 albums of 2020:

01. Taylor Swift - Folklore
02. Perfume Genius - Set My Heart On Fire Immediately
03. Moses Sumney - Grae
04. The Strokes - The New Abnormal
05. Charli XCX - How I'm Feeling Now
06. Sufjan Stevens - The Ascension
07. Hayley Williams - Petals For Armor
08. The Weeknd - After Hours
09. Grimes - Miss_Anthropocene
10. Phoebe Bridgers - Punisher
11. Run The Jewels - Run The Jewels 4

--- (some additional thoughts on this set of albums) ---

You could place any one of the top 3 albums on #1 here, and I would sign off on that list. Just all absolute smashers and early AOTD contenders.

I hope everyone remembers the way this Strokes album was treated this year when they release the next album. Because crimes were committed here and we need to respect motherfucking craft when we see it.

Hayley Williams released the most underrated album of the year, and Charli released the most effortless modern pop classic of the year.

Please dont @ me about The Weeknd, I dont know what happened! one minute I was jamming to Blinding Lights and before i could really think about it, i was just jamming that hard to the entire album. I can't quite completely explain it, I don't know if this will hold up, but the weeknd made my most played album of the year.

I am nothing if not loyal once i fall for an artist, and Sufjan, Grimes and RTJ all made applause worthy comebacks, and so I must continue to stan.

And Phoebe Bridgers just has my whole entire heart

20 of my 2020 (so far). Not in any real order, I'm just numbering them to limit myself to a reasonable amount.

1. Fetch the Bolt Cutters - Fiona Apple (2020). She's always been a bit of a slow burner for me as a listener, but this just knocked my socks clean off from the first. Even better, it keeps getting richer the more I listen to it. A perfectly formed sonic world to retreat into during an especially insular year. Cozy and unfamiliar.

2. Don Juan's Reckless Daughter - Joni Mitchell (1977). I got super into Joni a couple years back after nonstop listening to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly (which just reminded me a lot of her music). I was a huge fan but only of a limited number of LPs, and I ended up stretching into a lot of records I'd avoided or dismissed. Don Juan's Reckless Daughter was one of the last to really get my attention, mainly because it's one of her worst reviewed and the cover has her in blackface (which really hurts). Fuck, this album is incredible. It's become my favorite album of hers.

3. Perfection & Permanence (2014) and Kainskult (2017) - Trepaneringsritualen. These albums are mammoth and I love them and they've opened up new avenues for me personally and musically.

4. græ - Moses Sumney (2020). Just a hugely cinematic listening experience. Which conjures up images of big-budget, wide open vistas full of color and detail and movement and air and it has all that, absolutely, but it's also cinematic in terms of the films of Robert Bresson or Agnès Varda or Julie Dash or Derek Jarman. It's the kind of album that makes me want to learn more.

5. La vita nuova EP - Christine and the Queens (2020). Pure pleasure.

6. Grave of a Dog - Sightless Pit (2020).

7. Look Alive - The Stroppies (2020).

8. ALFREDO - Freddie Gibbs and The Alchemist (2020).

9. Impossible Princess (1997) and DISCO (2020) - Kylie Minogue. To be perfectly honest, I'm still processing the new one. For me, there tends to be three kinds of Kylie albums: the pick 'n mix, where a variety of approaches are explored (Light Years, X, Kiss Me Once), the thematic album, where there's a lyrical journey and a musical vibe perfectly locked in sync (Aphrodite, Body Language, Impossible Princess), and the concept album, where it's one idea expressed cleanly across the board (Fever, Kylie Minogue). Occasionally an album can slot neatly into two columns (Golden is thematic and concept, especially in it's "deluxe edition" tracklist). DISCO seems to land squarely in the concept column, which is usually the least interesting option. Still sussing out the hidden ingredients in the flavor profile, but it's delicious nonetheless.

10. Times of Grace- Neurosis (1999).

11. Modus Vivendi - 070 Shake (2020). Why wasn't this album, like, reasonably huge? It even seems to have escaped the kind of media praise it fully deserves, far as I can tell. If COVID hadn't thwarted her tour with The (ugh) 1975, I think we'd be seeing this on more End of Year lists.

12. KiCk i - Arca (2020). Hyper. Sexy. And hyper//sexy.

13. Two Creation Myths - The Native Cats (2020).

14. Forever Gold - Dionne Warwicke (1973). A fundamental album in my musical upbringing, this compilation is absolutely totemic for me. I found a sealed copy on eBay, so I splurged and treated myself (with fifteen bucks of my pandemic relief check!). Totally worth it, obvi.

15. Live Forever - Bartees Strange (2020).

16. Underground - Thelonious Monk (1968).

17. Go Tell the Fox (sampler) - Jim Ferguson (2020). Oh, the fucking ego. This is a set of tracks I made scoring an imaginary film. I actually enjoy it, and will listen to it on purpose, for pleasure.

18. The Next Day - David Bowie (2013).

19. Rough and Rowdy Ways - Bob Dylan (2020).

20. Second Childhood - Phoebe Snow (1976).

There's more, of course. There's always more. But that's enough.

It's always too early! I'm not ready!

I'll still throw a quick list of some of my favorites that aren't here:

*Adrianne Lenker - songs
Might be my AOTY. Or at least the one that was the most therapeutic. I've definitely cried listening to it, and I've definitely reached for it when I was crying ❤️

*Backxwash - God Has Nothing to Do With It...
I was lucky enough to cover a socially distant festival in September where she played, and it was one of the best shows I've ever seen. Amazing album, mixing heavy metal samples, rap and black magic. It's bold and aggressive and scary, but the girl is actually a total sweetheart in person

Rina Sawayama - SAWAYAMA
Honestly baffled the album isn't there. One of the best, if not the best Pop record of the year for me.

*Lianne La Havas - Lianne La Havas
Such a sweet, organic album. It sounds like the ray of warm, natural light penetrating through the window

There are more, but I'd say these are my absolute favorite forgotten ones

The top three albums here probably comprised 75% of my music listening this year. I feel like I know every single contour of each of them, like they're permanently a part of me now. I'd almost consider it a three way tie for first.

Having dove so deeply into a relatively small number of albums, I feel like I kind of missed a lot of music this year. Cruising thru the 'gum top 50, perusing back through all the AOTWs this year, looking at P4K's 8.0+ list, I see a ton of stuff that I slept on, but am hyped to check out. I'm sure the comments section will give me a bunch too. Many thanks to the entire community here—I appreciate all that you teach me.

Here's the deal. The dua lipa album is top 10 like it or not. Lets be honest here. Fiona Apple whom I love n adore, made another seller album but not the top album of the year. And BTW no Tame Impala in this top 50, top 10, or not top 5, makes this list a fucking joke. I wanted 2 hate that album. BUT IT FUCKING BANGZ. And the car seat head rest album is 50× better than you all think. Its a complete sleeper. #dontsleep

1. Sault - Untitled (Black Is)
2. Yves Tumor - Heaven to a Tortured Mind
3. Charli XCX - how i’m feeling now
4. Jeff Rosenstock - NO DREAM
5. Open Mike Eagle - Anime, Trauma, and Divorce
6. US Girls - Heavy Liight
7. Thundercat - It Is What It Is
8. Kamaiyah - Got It Made
9. Chris Crack - White People Love Algorithms
10. Georgia - Seeking Thrills

Obviously I picked Sault’s Black Is over Rise. They are both great but only one has “Stop Dem” and “Wildfires” and probably listened to those two songs the most this second half of the year. The first half definitely consisted of listening to Yves Tumor’s “Kerosene” again and again and again.

The new music that spoke to me the most this year was from Wytch Hazel, Bethlehem, Grift, Revolutionary Army of the Infant Jesus, and Kloster. Other than that music was sorta alright in 2020

17. Waxahatchee - Saint Cloud
18. Vuur & Zijde / Impavida
19. Ela Minus - acts of rebellion
20. After Dark 3

how i'm feeling now is the main album that I constantly came back to this year, and the only one I could listen to two or three times in a row on any given night. So that was an easy top pick for me. That album just made a lot of sense this year. Probably my new favorite Charli album.

Super late to this party once again but for all its worth here are my top 10
1. Phoebe Bridgers - Punisher - worked well on all levels for me
2. SAULT - Untitled (Black Is)
3. Porridge Radio - Every Bad
4. Fiona Apple - Fetch The Bolt Cutters
5. Drab City - Good Songs For Bad People
6. Adrianne Lenker - Songs/Instrumentals - technically 2 albums but...
7. Sorry -925 - felt like I had already heard a large chunk of this album via their EP and single releases, but they added plenty of new material that was solid
8. Warnings - I Break Horses - as a big fan of her debut album, big fan of this one
9. Four Tet - Sixteen Oceans
10. What We Drew - Yaeji

Biggest Disappointments:
1. Sufjan Stevens - The Ascension - just didn't do it for me.
2. Car Seat Headrest - Making a Door Less Open - erased most of this album from my mind. Hollywood is probably one of the worst songs I have ever heard.
3. Caribou - Suddenly - didn't hate it and actually had a few tracks I really enjoyed, but it was always going to be hard to follow up Our Love

Biggest Surprises (new discoveries)
1. Drab City - formerly known as oOoOO which I had no idea until much later
2. Ratboys - all around fun album
3. SAULT - had no idea about them prior to this year when they dropped Black Is right in the middle of this Summer's protests.

Favorite music memory this year:
Driving across Colorado in the mountains east of Gunnison listening to Moodymann

And that Deserta album is incredible, for anyone that likes their shoegaze mixed with some sweet epic-ness.

Am I the only surprised to see that SAULT didn't get way more love? Either one of their albums could have been near/at the top of the list.

Gotta wonder if its because they don't do press and are quiet on social media AKA give the music industry content so they can sell advertising and shit...

Whose_Yer
I wish there were 50 album releases I wanted to listen to. Personally, I like Real Estate’s The Main Thing a lot and the omission of Tame Impala is silly. It would be in the Top 10 if it was their first or second release. My favorite releases in know particular order.
Soccer Mommy
Yves Tumor
Fleet Foxes
Tame Impala
Real Estate
Thundercat
Blitzen Trapper
The Flaming Lips
I really like Fiona Apple but I can’t listen to Fetch the Bolt Cutters. Glad people enjoy it just not my thing.

12/2/20 6:54 AM+1REPLY

Too Many Birds
I agree with a lot of what you're saying here. That Real Estate album is pretty underrated. I think there were unstated expectations of them to change/improve their sound somehow which I don't think is necessary because it's a good sound. Also agree with your assessment of Fetch The Bolt Cutters. I like FA too and recognize her talent but realistically I'm not finding myself listening to FTBC.

12/2/20 7:55 AM+1REPLY

Whose_Yer
couldn't agree more....expectations do tend to sway critics and I get it to some degree but if it's good, it's good. Critics love that Fiona threw a curve and don't like that Tame Impala, or even Real Estate played it somewhat safe. I don't get payed to create these lists, I pay to listen to music.
I forgot MMJ Waterfall II...really enjoying it too.
